# This gdb script contains  some  useful   settings  and  functions  for
# debugging Prolog using gdb. Link or  copy   this  as `.gdbinit` to the
# directory where you want to debug Prolog.

# Trap some functions. trap_gdb() is a dummy  function that you may call
# conditionally at a place where  you  want   to  stop  in  gdb. This is
# similar to GDB breakpoint conditions, but these are quite slow.
