Integrated patches from Nishida Osamu (nishida@islix.sharp.co.jp) to
provide for 8-bit character support.

Thu Feb 18 16:12:10 1993  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swisun11)

* VERSION 1.6.12

Integrated port to OS2 (using EMX and gcc-2) made by Andreas Toenne
(atoenne@mpi-sb.mpg.de).  See README.os2


Wed Feb  3 10:42:23 1993  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swisun11)

* VERSION 1.6.10

* Fixed various installation problems for HP and LINUX.
* Incorporated various useful changes from
  ads@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk (Dave Sherratt (Daibhi)):

(1) I discovered that SWI-Prolog appears to treat all variables beginning
    with "_" as an anonymous variable. Only the variable "_" is the
    anonymous variable (see Clocksin and Mellish). I have modified a line
    in "pl-read.c" to ensure that only the variable "_" is the anonymous
    variable.

(2) The cputime measurement on H.P. machines is incorrect because the
    ticks per second is not 60Hz., as assumed in "pl-os.c". It is
    defined in <sys/param.h> (or whatever it includes) in "HZ". I have
    modified "pl-os.c" accordingly.

(3) For my interactive user sessions, various terminal control characters
    are redefined, in particular, the EOF character is set to <CTRL Z>,
    and the DSUSP character is set to <CTRL D>. O.K. it's perverse, but,
    with the other Prologs I have used (with the possible exception of
    Quintus Prolog) the EOF character is honoured.
    With SWI-Prolog, there were problems because of the above mentioned
    control char. shuffling, and its assumption that they have their
    default values. I have modified code in "pl-os.h", "pl-file.c",
    "pl-os.c" and "pl-read.c" so that the EOF character (and currently
    only this character) is honoured.


Tue Jan  5 17:50:50 1993  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swi)

VERSION 1.6.8

* Fixed declaration of wam_table[] in pl-incl.h 

* Added CANONICAL_PATHS environment variable to tailor processing
  of canonical paths.

Tue Oct 20 14:32:24 1992  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swi)

* Added expand_term/2 system predicate for compatibility with
  SICStus and Quintus Prolog on this matter.

VERSION 1.6.5

Fri Jun 19 17:34:44 1992  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swi)

* Added support for static linking with C-code: see pl-extend.c
* Added pl-save.[ch]: new save_program/[1,2], save/[1,2] and restore/1.
  Probably much more portable.  Makes unexec() redundant.  Once portability
  and proper operation is proven, this will be removed.
* Various minor things in the instalation have been changed.
* Fixed a bug in dynamic stack allocation.

VERSION 1.6.1

Thu Apr 30 15:56:46 1992  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swi)

* Fixed decompilation-bug for (If->Then->Else), introduced with the
  changes for the O_VMCODE_IS_ADDRESS option.


VERSION 1.5.9

Thu Apr  9 11:06:11 1992  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swix)

* Exploided the features of GCC-2 to get the addresses of local labels and
  jump to them.  See O_LABEL_ADDRESSES and O_VMCODE_IS_ADDRESS options in
  pl-incl.h.  Gains about 10% for the chat program.  Compile-time
  unification instructions probably generate the largest improvement.

VERSION 1.5.8

Mon Apr  6 21:51:18 1992  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swix)

* Finally fixed read-callback for proper cooperation with XPCE.
* Fixed undefined-predicate exceptions not to loop.
* Fixed read to reset 'unget' variable.

VERSION 1.5.7

Mon Mar 30 11:23:10 1992  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swisun11)

* Integrated port for LINUX.
* Minor bugfixes.

VERSION 1.5.6

Tue Dec 17 10:57:51 1991  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swirs1)

* Changed use_module/[1,2] (actually $load_module/4) to deal with
  restarting saved states on machines yielding different results for
  pwd or after moving the library.

VERSION 1.5.5

* Improved port to the IBM RISC/6000 system.  This includes:

  *) Renamed md-rios.h into md-rs6000.h
  *) Fixed save_program/[1,2] for this machine
  *) Fixed load_foreign/... for this machine.  Note there are problems
     with the interaction between load_foreign/.. and save_program/[1,2].
     See pl-load.c for details.
  *) Fixed O_PROFILE
  *) Tried to get O_DYNAMIC_STACKS working.  I've still the impression
     it can be done; but it is very difficult.  Notably because all
     memory mapping must be at segment boundaries (alligned at 0x10000000
     multiples).  This will exceed the addressing capabilities of Prologs
     tagged types.  Is there a real AIX guru that is willing to help?
  
* Changed the Makefile to allow for compiler options in the md- files.

VERSION 1.5.4

Thu Oct 31 18:01:54 1991  Jan Wielemaker  (jan at swisun11)

* Fixed history.pl to deal properly with '$set_prompt'(+Prompt).

VERSION 1.5.3
