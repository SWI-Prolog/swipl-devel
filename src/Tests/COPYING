# The license conditions of the SWI-Prolog test suite

Most of the SWI-Prolog test suite is   licensed under the simplified BSD
(BSD-2) license. Some of the test files  are licensed under the GPL with
exception clause and we have  no   explicit  permission  to change their
license. As the license of test  files   does  not affect the license of
SWI-Prolog as a system there is no   reason  to challenge whether or not
the contributions are subject to copyright,  nor   is  there a reason to
replace or remove these test files.
