# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_C_FLOAT_WORDS_BIGENDIAN([ACTION-IF-TRUE], [ACTION-IF-FALSE], [ACTION-IF-UNKNOWN])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks the ordering of words within a multi-word float. This check is
#   necessary because on some systems (e.g. certain ARM systems), the float
#   word ordering can be different from the byte ordering. In a multi-word
#   float context, "big-endian" implies that the word containing the sign
#   bit is found in the memory location with the lowest address. This
#   implemenation was inspired by the AC_C_BIGENDIAN macro in autoconf.
#
#   The endianess is detected by first compiling C code that contains a
#   special double float value, then grepping the resulting object file for
#   certain strings of ASCII values. The double is specially crafted to have
#   a binary representation that corresponds with a simple string. In this
#   implementation, the string "noonsees" was selected because the
#   individual word values ("noon" and "sees") are palindromes, thus making
#   this test byte-order agnostic. If grep finds the string "noonsees" in
#   the object file, the target platform stores float words in big-endian
#   order. If grep finds "seesnoon", float words are in little-endian order.
#   If neither value is found, the user is instructed to specify the
#   ordering.
