Purpose
=======

The `readline console'  provides  a   simple,  but  reasonable  powerful
console window for running standard I/O based applications that may wish
to access Windows functions.

The console window is inspired by both the X11 xterm application and the
GNU readline library.  The  text  is   buffered  to  provide  for window
resizing and scroll-back. When reading  input   by  line,  an Emacs like
editor is provided for editing  the  input   line.  Old  input lines are
remembered and used by the history system.


Edit functions
==============

The following edit functions are provided:

	Control-A	Beginning of line
	Control-B	Character backward
	Control-C	Generate interrupt
	Control-D	Delete character forwards, or end-of-file
	Control-E	End of line
	Control-F	Character forwards
	Control-I (TAB)	Complete (filename, may be programmed)
	Control-J (NL)	Enter (make line available)
	Control-K	Delete to end-of-line
	Control-M (RET)	Enter (make line available)
	Control-N	Next line in history
	Control-P	Previous line in history
	Control-T	Toggle characters around caret
	Control-U	Empty line
	Control-V	Paste
	Control-Z	End-of-file
	DEL		Delete character forwards
	BACKSPACE	Delete character backwards
	<-, ->		Move caret in line, with SHIFT down, move
			by word.
	Up, down	Move in history list

Mouse-bindings:

	Left:		Start selection, dragging extends the selection.

			selection is placed on the Windows clipboard.
