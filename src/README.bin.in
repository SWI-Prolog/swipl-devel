Installing the binary version:
==============================

The simplest method is to  make  a   *symbolic  link*  from  your public
executable directory to the executable  in   bin/pl.   Donot  *copy* the
executable, as it uses  the  information  from   the  link  to  find the
location of the libraries.

If you installed this directory as

	/usr/local/lib/pl-@PLVERSION@

do (as root):

	# cd /usr/local/bin
	# ln -s /usr/local/lib/pl-@PLVERSION@/bin/pl .


Customising the binary version
==============================:

You can make small customisations by making/editing a file called `plrc'
in the SWI-Prolog  home  directory.   This   file  is  consulted  before
personal initialisation files (~/.plrc) and before  the execution of the
-g initialisation goal.
