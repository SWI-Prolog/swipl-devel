.SH DESCRIPTION
SWI-Prolog is an ISO compatible Prolog compiler. It has a good
collection of built-in predicates, a large set of which it shares with
Edinburgh C-Prolog, Quintus Prolog and SICStus Prolog.  Among its features
are a very fast compiler, a Quintus-like module system, library autoloading,
garbage collection, atom garbage collection, fast bi-directional C
interface, true C++ interface, execution profiling and many more.

All of SWI-Prolog and its packages should work out-of-the-box on
ELF-based Unix systems using gcc. On other Unix systems or using another
C-compiler it is often required to tweak a bit with the compiler options
to get the foreign packages compiled. For MS-Windows Makefiles and tools
are maintained seperately. The status on other non-POSIX platforms is
varying and unstable.

This manual page only lists the commandline options.  Full documentation
is available on-line as well as in
.BR HTML " and " PDF
format from the WWW home page.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-help
Gives a summary of the most important options.
.TP
.B \-v
Displays version and architecture information.
.TP
.B \-arch
Prints the architecture identifier.
.TP
.B \-dump\-runtime\-variables
Dump information that is generally useful for installation scripts in
a form compatible with the
.B sh
(bourne) shell.  This option is used by
.B plld (1)
to fetch necessary information about Prolog.  It is normally invoked as
.I eval `@PL@ -dump-runtime-variables`,
which assigns the following shell variables:
.RS
.TP
.B CC
The
.B C\-
compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog.
.TP
.B PLBASE
The home directory of SWI-Prolog.  This is the same value as returned
by the
.I current_prolog_flag home.
.TP
.B PLARCH
The architecture identifier used.  Together with 
.B PLBASE
this defines the location of various components.  For example,
the library for embedding is in
.B $PLBASE/runtime/$PLARCH/libpl.a
.TP
.B PLLIBS
The required libraries for linking
.B libpl.a
.TP
.B PLLDFLAGS
Flags that need to be passed to the C-linker for linking embedded executables.
.TP
.B PLSOEXT
Extension used by the hosting operating system for shared objects. On most
Unix systems this is "so"; on MS-Windows it is "dll".  AIX uses "o", HPUX
"sl".
.TP
.B PLVERSION
Numeric representation of the SWI-Prolog version.
.TP
.B PLSHARED
Has the value
.B yes
if Prolog supports linking shared libraries using
.B load_foreign_library/[1,2]
and
.B no
otherwise.
.TP
.B PLTHREADS
Has the value
.B yes
if Prolog was compiled for multi-threading and
.B no
otherwise.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-A size [km]
Sets the argument stack size to
.I size.
The default is 1 Mbytes.  The argument-size determines the maximum
term-nesting of terms that can be compiled and executed.  Both the compiler
and virtual machine use `last-argument optimisation', so -for example- long
lists do not require the argument stack. See also the
.B \-L
option.
.TP
.BI \-G size [km]
Sets the global stack size to
.I size.
The default is 4 Mbytes.  The global stack is used to store compound
terms, floating point numbers, big integers and strings. See also the
.B \-L
option.
.TP
.BI \-L size [km]
Sets the local stack size to
.I size.
The default unit is Kbytes.  The local stack is used to store environment
frames, choicepoints and foreign-language term-references.  Note that
SWI-Prolog does last-call optimisation to minimize the local stack
requirements. If the argument ends in
.B m ,
the argument is interpreted in Mbytes.
This flag sets the maximum value to which the stack is
allowed to grow (default 2048). A maximum is useful to prevent buggy
programs from claiming all the memory resources.
.B \-L0
sets the limit to the highest possible value.
.TP
.BI \-O
Optimised compilation. See
.B please/3
in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.
.TP
.BI \-T size
Sets the trail stack size to
.I size
K bytes. The default is 4096. See
.B \-L
for more details.
.TP
.BI \-b " initfile ... " -c " file ..."
Boot compilation.
.I "initfile ..."
are compiled by the C written bootstrap compiler,
.I "file ..."
by the normal Prolog compiler into an intermediate code file. This
option is for system maintenance and is given for reference only.
.TP
.BI \-c " file ..."
Compiles
.I "file ..."
into an intermediate code file.
.TP
.BI \-d " level"
Set debug level to
.IR level .
This option is for system maintenance and is given for reference only.
.TP
.BI \-f " file"
Use
.I "file"
as initialisation file instead of
.RB "`" .plrc "'. `" "-f none" "'"
stops SWI-Prolog from searching for an initialisation file.
.TP
.BI \-F " file"
Select startup script from the SWI-Prolog home directory.
.I file
Specifies the base-name of the script.  The extension is
.I .rc.
The default script is deduced from the basename of the executable,
taking all leading alphanumerical (letters, digits and underscore)
from the program name.  Thus if the program is named
.I swi-2.0
it will try to load the file
.I swi.rc
from the SWI-Prolog home directory.  If the file does not exist, or
the user has no read-access to it, the script is silently not loaded.
.TP
.BI \-s " file"
Load
.I file
as a script.  This option may be used from the shell to make
Prolog load a file before entering the toplevel.  It is also
used to turn a file into an executable Prolog script on Unix
systems using the following first line
.RS
.TP
.BR #!@prefix@/bin/@PL@ " option ... " \-s
.RE
.TP
.B \-q
Operate silently.  This option suppresses all
.I informational
messages, such as for compiling files.
.TP
.BI \-g " goal"
.I Goal
is executed just before entering the top level. The default is a
predicate which prints the welcome message. The welcome message
can thus be suppressed by giving
.BR "\-g true" .
.I goal
can be a complex term. In this case, quotes are normally needed
to protect it from being expanded by the Unix shell.
.TP
.BI \-o " output"
Used in combination with
.B \-b
or
.B \-c
to determine the output file for compilation.
.TP
.BI \-p " alias" = pathlist
Define a path alias for
.BR file_search_path/2 .
.I pathlist
is a "`":"'" separated list of values for the alias. See
.B file_search_path/2
in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.
.TP
.BI \-t " goal"
Use
.I goal
as an interactive top level instead of the default goal
.BR prolog/0 .
.I goal
can be a complex term. If the top level goal succeeds, SWI-Prolog
exits with status 0. If it fails, the exit status is 1. This flag
also determines the goal started by
.B break/0
and
.BR abort/0 .
If you want to stop the user from entering interactive mode, start
the application with
.RB "`" \-g
.IR goal "'"
and give
.RB "`" halt "'"
as the top level.
.TP
.BI \-x " bootfile"
Start from an intermediate code file resulting from a Prolog compilation
using the
.B \-b
or
.B \-c
option, or created using
.B qsave_program/[1,2].
.TP
.RB [ \+ | \- ] tty
Switches tty control (using 
.BR ioctl (2))
on
.RB ( \+tty ") or off ("  \-tty ")."
Normally tty control is switched on. This default depends on the
installation. You may wish to switch tty control off if SWI-Prolog is
used from an editor such as GNU Emacs. If switched off,
.B get_single_char/1
and the tracer will wait for a carriage return.
.TP
.B \-\-
Stops scanning for more arguments.
.SH ON-LINE HELP
SWI-Prolog has on-line help. This provides a fast lookup and browsing
facility to the SWI-Prolog Reference manual. The on-line manual can
show predicate definitions as well as entire sections of the manual.
.TP
.B help
Equivalent to
.BR help(help/1) .
.TP
.BI help( \+What )
Show a specified part of the manual.
.I What
is one of:
.RS
.TP
Name/Arity
give help on the specified predicate
.TP
Name
give help on the named predicate with any arity or a C interface
function with that name.
.TP
Section
display the specified section of the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.
Section numbers are dash separated numbers: e.g.
.B 2-3
refers to section 2.3 of the manual.
.PP
If Prolog is used together with the
.BR GUI
tool
.BR XPCE,
these predicates start a graphical interface, providing a coherent interface
to
.BR help/1,
.BR apropos/1
and
.BR explain/1.
.RE
.SH FILES
This installation of SWI-Prolog has been configured using the configure
option
