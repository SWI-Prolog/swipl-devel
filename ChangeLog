			SWI-Prolog ChangeLog
			====================

					--------------------------------------
					NOTE: Bug #<N> refers to bugs reported
					to the SWI-Prolog Bugzilla system at
					http://gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl/bugzilla/
					--------------------------------------


  * ADDED: wide character support for atoms and strings, foreign interfaces
    and some of the atom-handling predicates.

  * CLEANUP: interfaces for storing, accessing and save/load of strings.

  * ADDED: wide character encoding/decoding support for character I/O.
    See open/4 and set_stream/2.

  * MODIFIED: toplevel does not prompt if the user_input stream is not
    connected to a terminal.  Using set_stream(user_input, tty(true))
    the system can be forced to think input comes from a terminal.
    After comments from Roberto Bagnara.

  * ADDED: set_stream(S, tty(Bool)), stream_property(S, tty(Bool)) to
    find out/presume whether a terminal is attached to a stream.

  * ADDED: cyclic_term/1 and acyclic_term/1.  Paul Singleton.

VERSION 5.4.3 (October 18, 2004)
================================

  * PORT: Solaris _FILE_OFFSET_BITS issues in rc library.  Based on
    comments from Ian Collier.

  * FIXED: avoid deletion of clauses for dynamic predicates on reload.
    Hugo Ferreira.


VERSION 5.4.2 (October 02, 2004)
================================

  * FIXED: Garbage collector bug in handling trailed assignments.  This
    code is used by attributed variables, setarg/3 and backtrackable
    global variables.


VERSION 5.4.1 (September 30, 2004)
==================================

  * ADDED/MODIFIED: strip_module/3 is now a public and documented
    built-in.  The old undocumented '$strip_module'/3 has been moved
    to the backward compatibility library.  Applications should not
    notice the difference, but it is adviced to update your application
    accordingly.

  * ADDED: '$btree_find_node'/4 to speed up binary tree handling.

  * FIXED: Bug#193: reading */* .  Sandro Hawke.

  * FIXED: nb_setarg/3 using compound terms.

  * FIXED: Attributes should not influence the standard order of terms for
    variables.

  * FIXED: allow for ISO :- dynamic(a/2, b/3, c/4). style declarations.
    Spotted by Paulo Moura.  Actually I think it is a bug in the ISO
    standard :-)


VERSION 5.4.0 (September 21, 2004)
==================================

  * ADDED: write_term/3 using option numbervars(true) writes atoms
    appearing as argument to '$VAR'(X) without quotes.  I.e.
    write_term(x('$VAR'('Foo')), [quoted(true), numbervars(true)])
    writes "x(Foo)".

  * FIXED: throw/1 crashed on attributed variables in the ball.

  * ADDED: option list to numbervars/4.

  * ADDED: return value for PL_put_blob() to indicate new/reused blob
    identifier.  Also added `acquire' hook to the blob type.
