/** <module> Manage Prolog break-points

This module provides an  interface  for   development  tools  to set and
delete break-points, giving a location in  the source. Development tools
that want to track changes to   breakpoints must use user:message_hook/3
to intercept these message terms:

  * breakpoint(set, Id)
  * breakpoint(delete, Id)

Note that the hook must fail  after   creating  its side-effects to give
other hooks the opportunity to react.

%%	set_breakpoint(+File, +Line, +Char, -Id) is det.
%
%	Put a breakpoint at the  indicated   source-location.  File is a
%	current sourcefile (as reported by   source_file/1). Line is the
%	1-based line in which Char  is.  Char   is  the  position of the
%	break.
%
%	First, '$clause_from_source'/3 uses the SWI-Prolog clause-source
%	information to find  the  last   clause  starting  before  Line.
%	'$break_pc' generated (on backtracking),  a   list  of  possible
%	break-points.
%
%	Note that in addition to  setting   the  break-point, the system
%	must be in debug mode. With threading enabled, there are various
%	different ways this may  be  done.   See  debug/0,  tdebug/0 and
%	tdebug/1. Therefore, this predicate  does   *not*  enable  debug
%	mode.
