/** <module> High level thread primitives

This  module  defines  simple  to  use   predicates  for  running  goals
concurrently.  Where  the  core  multi-threaded    API  is  targeted  at
communicating long-living threads, the predicates   here  are defined to
run goals concurrently without having to   deal with thread creation and
maintenance explicitely.

Note that these predicates run goals   concurrently  and therefore these
goals need to be thread-safe. As  the   predicates  in  this module also
abort branches of the computation that  are no longer needed, predicates
that have side-effect must act properly.  In   a  nutshell, this has the
following consequences:

  * Nice clean Prolog code without side-effects (but with cut) works
    fine.
  * Side-effects are bad news.  If you really need assert to store
    intermediate results, use the thread_local/1 declaration.  This
    also guarantees cleanup of left-over clauses if the thread is
    cancelled.  For other side-effects, make sure to use call_cleanup/2
    to undo them should the thread be cancelled.
  * Global variables are ok as they are thread-local and destroyed
    on thread cancellation.  Note however that global variables in
    the calling thread are *not* available in the threads that are
    created.  You have to pass the value as an argument and initialise
    the variable in the new thread.
  * Thread-cancellation uses thread_signal/2.  Using this code
    with long-blocking foreign predicates may result in long delays,
    even if another thread asks for cancellation.

%!  concurrent(+N, :Goals, +Options) is semidet.
%
%   Run Goals in parallel using N   threads.  This call blocks until
%   all work has been done.  The   Goals  must  be independent. They
%   should not communicate using shared  variables   or  any form of
%   global data. All Goals must be thread-safe.
%
%   Execution succeeds if all goals  have   succeeded.  If  one goal
%   fails or throws an exception,  other   workers  are abandoned as
%   soon as possible and the entire   computation fails or re-throws
%   the exception. Note that if  multiple   goals  fail  or raise an
%   error it is not defined which error or failure is reported.
%
%   On successful completion, variable bindings   are returned. Note
%   however that threads have independent   stacks and therefore the
%   goal is copied to the worker  thread   and  the result is copied
%   back to the caller of concurrent/3.
%
%   Choosing the right number of threads is not always obvious. Here
%   are some scenarios:
%
%     * If the goals are CPU intensive and normally all succeeding,
%     typically the number of CPUs is the optimal number of
%     threads.  Less does not use all CPUs, more wastes time in
%     context switches and also uses more memory.
%
%     * If the tasks are I/O bound the number of threads is
%     typically higher than the number of CPUs.
%
%     * If one or more of the goals may fail or produce an error,
%     using a higher number of threads may find this earlier.
%
%   @arg N Number of worker-threads to create. Using 1, no threads
%        are created.  If N is larger than the number of Goals we
%        create exactly as many threads as there are Goals.
%   @arg Goals List of callable terms.
%   @arg Options Passed to thread_create/3 for creating the
%        workers.  Only options changing the stack-sizes can
%        be used. In particular, do not pass the detached or alias
%        options.
%   @see In many cases, concurrent_maplist/2 and friends
%        is easier to program and is tractable to program
%        analysis.

%!  concurrent_maplist(:Goal, +List1, +List2, +List3) is semidet.
%
%   Concurrent version of maplist/2. This   predicate uses concurrent/3,
%   using multiple _worker_ threads.  The  number   of  threads  is  the
%   minimum of the list length and the   number  of cores available. The
%   number of cores is determined using  the prolog flag =cpu_count=. If
%   this flag is absent or 1 or List   has  less than two elements, this
%   predicate calls the corresponding maplist/N  version using a wrapper
%   based on once/1. Note that all goals   are executed as if wrapped in
%   once/1 and therefore these predicates are _semidet_.
%
%   Note that the the overhead  of   this  predicate is considerable and
%   therefore Goal must  be  fairly  expensive   before  one  reaches  a
%   speedup.

%!  first_solution(-X, :Goals, +Options) is semidet.
%
%   Try  alternative  solvers  concurrently,   returning  the  first
%   answer. In a typical scenario, solving any of the goals in Goals
%   is satisfactory for the application to  continue. As soon as one
%   of the tried alternatives is  successful,   all  the others are
%   killed and first_solution/3 succeeds.
%
%   For example, if it is unclear whether   it is better to search a
%   graph breadth-first or depth-first we can use:
%
%   ==
%   search_graph(Grap, Path) :-
%            first_solution(Path, [ breadth_first(Graph, Path),
%                                   depth_first(Graph, Path)
%                                 ],
%                           []).
%   ==
%
%   Options include thread stack-sizes passed   to thread_create, as
%   well as the options =on_fail= and   =on_error= that specify what
%   to do if a  solver  fails  or   triggers  an  error.  By default
%   execution of all  solvers  is  terminated   and  the  result  is
%   returned. Sometimes one may wish to  continue. One such scenario
%   is if one of the solvers may run  out of resources or one of the
%   solvers is known to be incomplete.
%
%           * on_fail(Action)
%           If =stop= (default), terminate all threads and stop with
%           the failure.  If =continue=, keep waiting.
%           * on_error(Action)
%           As above, re-throwing the error if an error appears.
%
%   @bug    first_solution/3 cannot deal with non-determinism.  There
%           is no obvious way to fit non-determinism into it.  If multiple
%           solutions are needed wrap the solvers in findall/3.
