/** <module> SICStus 4 compatibility library

This library is intended to be activated using the directive below in
files that are designed for use with SICStus Prolog 4. The changes are in
effect until the end of the file and in each file loaded from this file.

    ==
    :- expects_dialect(sicstus4).
    ==

This library only provides compatibility with version 4 of SICStus Prolog.
For SICStus Prolog 3 compatibility, use library(dialect/sicstus) instead.

@tbd	The dialect-compatibility packages are developed in a
	`demand-driven' fashion. Please contribute to this package.

% Note: Although the do operator is declared here, do loops currently
% aren't emulated by library(dialect/sicstus4).

%%	rename_module(?SICStus4Module, ?RenamedSICStus4Module) is nondet.
%
%	True if RenamedSICStus4Module is the  name  that  we use for the
%	SICStus 4 native module SICStus4Module. We do this in places where
%	the module-name conflicts. All explicitly qualified goals are
%	mapped to the SICStus 4 equivalent of the module.

%%	nonmember(?Element, ?List) is semidet.
%
%	True if Element doesn't unify with any element in List.
%	No variables are bound.

nonmember(Element, List) :- \+ memberchk(Element, List).

% Provide (\)/2 as arithmetic function.  Ideally, we should be able to
% bind multiple names to built-in functions.  This is rather slow.  We
% could also consider adding \ internally, but not turning it into an
% operator.
