/** <module> Modify solution sequences

The meta predicates of this library modify  the sequence of solutions of
a goal. The modifications and  the  predicate   names  are  based on the
classical database operations DISTINCT,  LIMIT,   OFFSET,  ORDER  BY and
GROUP BY.

These   predicates   were   introduced   in     the   context   of   the
[SWISH](http://swish.swi-prolog.org) Prolog browser-based   shell, which
can represent the solutions to a predicate  as a table. Notably wrapping
a goal in distinct/1 avoids duplicates  in   the  result table and using
order_by/2 produces a nicely ordered table.

However, the predicates from this  library  can   also  be  used to stay
longer within the clean paradigm  where non-deterministic predicates are
composed  from  simpler  non-deterministic  predicates    by   means  of
conjunction and disjunction. While evaluating   a  conjunction, we might
want to eliminate duplicates of the first part of the conjunction. Below
we give both the classical  solution   for  solving variations of (a(X),
b(X)) and the ones using this library side-by-side.

  $ Avoid duplicates of earlier steps :

    ==
      setof(X, a(X), Xs),		distinct(a(X)),
      member(X, Xs),			b(X)
      b(X).
    ==

    Note that the distinct/1 based solution returns the first result
    of distinct(a(X)) immediately after a/1 produces a result, while
    the setof/3 based solution will first compute all results of a/1.

  $ Only try b(X) only for the top-10 a(X) :

    ==
      setof(X, a(X), Xs),		limit(10, order_by([desc(X)], a(X))),
      reverse(Xs, Desc),		b(X)
      first_max_n(10, Desc, Limit),
      member(X, Limit),
      b(X)
    ==

    Here we see power of composing primitives from this library and
    staying within the paradigm of pure non-deterministic relational
    predicates.
