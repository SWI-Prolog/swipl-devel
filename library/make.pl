/** <module>  Reload modified source files

This module provides the SWI-Prolog   `make'  facility that synchronises
Prolog internal database after loaded files have been edited.

@bug    Dependency tracking is incomplete.  Notably, there is no
        dependency tracking if compilation of one module depends
        on goal_expansion/2 or term_expansion/2 rules provided by
        another.

%!  make
%
%   Reload all source files that have   been changed since they were
%   loaded. This predicate peforms the following steps:
%
%     1. Compute the set of files that need to be reloaded.
%     2. Call the hook prolog:make_hook(before, Files)
%     3. Reload the files
%     4. Call the hook prolog:make_hook(after, Files)
%     5. If (4) fails, call list_undefined/0.
%
%   The hooks are called  with  an  empty   list  if  no  files need
%   reloading.

%!  prolog:make_hook(+When, +Files) is semidet.
%
%   This hook is called by make/0. It   is called with the following
%   values for When:
%
%     - before
%     The hook is called before reloading starts. The default
%     action is to do nothing.
%
%     - after
%     The hook is called after reloading completed.  The default
%     action is to call list_undefined/1 as:
%
%       ==
%       list_undefined([scan(local)]).
%       ==
%
%   The hook can be  used  to   change  program  validation, stop or
%   restart services, etc.
%
%   @arg Files is a list holding the canonical file names of the
%        files that need to be reloaded.  This list can be empty.
