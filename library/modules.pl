%!  in_temporary_module(?Module, :Setup, :Goal)
%
%   Run Goal on temporary loaded sources  and discard the module and
%   loaded predicates after completion.  This predicate performs the
%   following steps:
%
%     1. If Module is unbound, create a unique identifier for it.
%     2. Turn Module into a _temporary_ module using set_module/1.
%        Note that this requires the module to be non-existent or
%        empty.  If Module is specified, it should typically be set
%        to a unique value as obtained from e.g. uuid/1.
%     3. Run Setup in the context of Module.
%     4. If setup succeeded possible choice points are discarded
%        and Goal is started.
%
%   The  logical  result  of  this   predicate    is   the  same  as
%   `(Setup@Module -> Goal@Module)`, i.e., both   Setup and Goal are
%   resolved relative to the current  module,   but  executed in the
%   context of Module.  If  Goal  must   be  called  in  Module, use
%   `call(Goal)`.
%
%   The module and all  its  predicates   are  destroyed  after Goal
%   terminates, as defined by setup_call_cleanup/3.
%
%   *Discussion* This predicate is intended to   load programs in an
%   isolated   environment   and   reclaim   all   resources.   This
%   unfortunately is incomplete:
%
%     - Running the code may leave side effects such as creating
%       records, flags, changing Prolog flags, etc.  The system
%       has no provisions to track this.
%     - So called _functors_ (name/arity pairs) are not yet subject
%       to garbage collection.  Functors are both used to define
%       predicates and to create compound terms.
%
%   @see    library(sandbox) determines whether unknown goals are safe
%           to call.
%   @see    load_files/2 offers the option sandboxed(true) to load code
%           from unknown sources safely.
