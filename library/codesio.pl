/** <module> I/O on Lists of Character Codes

This module emulates the SICStus  library   codesio.pl  for  reading and
writing from/to lists of character codes.   Most of these predicates are
straight calls into similar SWI-Prolog primitives.

This library is based on library(charsio)   that originates from Quintus
Prolog. The naming is updated to reflect  the ISO naming conventions and
the ISO predicats atom_codes/2, etc  are   obviously  removed  from this
library.
