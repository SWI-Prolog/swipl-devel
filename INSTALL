			=====================

The guide for installing SWI-Prolog  from   source  is maintained on the
SWI-Prolog website at the following location:

    http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/

Installing from source is typically  a  good   idea  on  Linux  and *BSD
systems. On MacOS it is adviced to   use the binary installer or install
from  source  using  Macports  or  Homebrew.   The  Windows  version  is
cross-compiled on a Linux machine. See README.mingw.
