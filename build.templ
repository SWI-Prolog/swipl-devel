# This is the script we use to   build  SWI-Prolog and all its packages.
# Copy the script to  `build',  edit   to  suit  the  local installation
# requirements and run it. Once correct, upgrading   to a new release is
# now limited to getting the new sources and run ./build.

# [EDIT] Prefix location of the installation. It is _not_ adviced to use
# a    versioned    prefix.    The    system      will     install    in
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version> and create symlinks from  $PREFIX/bin for the
# main  programs.  Users  can  always  use  older  versions  by  running
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version>/bin/<arch>/pl

PREFIX=$HOME

# [EDIT] Version of make to use.  This must be GNU-make.  On many
# proprietary Unix systems this is installed as 'gmake'.  On most
# open systems make is GNU-make.

MAKE=make

# [EDIT] Compiler and options.
# 
#	CC:	 Which C-compiler to use
#	COFLAGS: Flags for the optimizer such as "-O3" or "-g"
# 	CMFLAGS: Machine flags such as "-m64" (64-bits on gcc)
# 	CIFLAGS: Include-path such as "-I/opt/include"
# 	LDFLAGS: Link flags such as "-L/opt/lib"
#
# Leaving an option blank leaves the choice to configure

# export CC=
# export COFLAGS=
# export CMFLAGS=
# export CIFLAGS=
# export LDFLAGS=
  export CFLAGS="$CMFLAGS $CIFLAGS"

# [EDIT] Packages to configure.  Leaving it blank compiles all packages.
# export PKG=

# [EDIT] Packages to skip.  Leaving it blank compiles all packages.
# export DISABLE_PKGS="jpl ssl odbc"

# [EDIT] Where to find the jar for Junit 3.8.  Needed to test jpl
# export JUNIT=/opt/local/share/java/junit.jar

# [EDIT] On MacOS you need this to get some libraries from Darwinports
# export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib
# export CPATH=/opt/local/include
