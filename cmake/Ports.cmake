# Setup cross compiling.  As discussed with _erlanger_ in
# https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/issues/358#issuecomment-439675854
# we distinguish three scenarios for building:
#
#   1. Native compilation
#   2. Cross compilation with a good emulator (Wine for Windows, Node.js
#      for WASM)
#   3. Cross compilation without a usable emulator.
# 
# In case #3 we need to make two builds:
#   1. Compile SWI-Prolog on the build host with a compatible pointer size
#   2. Cross-compile to the final target
#
# The first step is used to produce build artifacts that are needed
# by the cross-compilation step. SWIPL_NATIVE_FRIEND points to the directory
# which contains the build for step #1.
#

# ${SWIPL_NATIVE_FRIEND}, is  either  the  name  of  a  sibling  build
# directory  containing  a compatible native SWI-Prolog or an absolute   path
# pointing at such a directory.  By compatible we mean that the pointer size
# is the same.
#
# The following variables are set, and can be used elsewhere:
#
#   - ${PROG_SWIPL} is a native or friend Prolog executable that can
#                   be used for general Prolog tasks such as generating
#                   the library index or documentation
#
#   - ${PROG_SWIPL_FOR_BOOT} is a native or friend Prolog executable that can
#                            be used for compiling bootNN.prc and .qlf files.
#                            At the moment it must have the same pointer size
#                            as the target.
#
# Note: The helper tools mkvmi and  defatoms   (see  src  directory) are built
# using ${CMAKE_HOST_CC} when cross-compiling, and do not need SWIPL_NATIVE_FRIEND.
