\begin{abstract}
This package realised external storage of Prolog terms based on the {\em
Berkeley DB} library from \url[Sleepycat
Software]{http://www.sleepycat.com}. The DB library implements modular
support for the bottom layers of a database. The database itself maps
unconstrained keys onto values. Both key and value are \jargon{binary
blobs}.

The SWI-Prolog interface for DB allows for fast storage of general
Prolog terms in the database.

\section{Introduction}

The native Prolog database is not very well suited for either {\em very}
large data-sets or dynamically changing large data-sets that need to be
communicated between Prolog instances or need to be safely guarded
against system failure.  These cases ask for an external database that
can be attached quickly and provides protection against system failure.

The Berkeley DB package by SleepyCat software is a GPL'ed library
realising the bottom-layers of a database.  It is a modular system,
which in it's simplest deals with resource management on a mapped
file and in its most complex form deals with network transparency,
transaction management, locking, recovery, life-backup, etc.

The DB library maps keys to values.  Optionally multiple values can be
associated with a key.  Both key and value are arbitrary-length binary
objects.

This package stores arbitrary Prolog terms, using PL_record_external()
introduced in SWI-Prolog 3.3.7, in the database. It provides an
interface similar to the recorded-database (recorda/3).  In the future
we plan to link this interface transparently to a predicate.


\subsection{About this manual}

This manual is by no means complete. The Berkeley DB documentation
should be consulted directly to resolve details on security, resource
usage, formats, configuration options etc. This interface passed default
values for most DB API calls. Supported options hint to the
corresponding DB API calls, which should be consulted for details.


\section{The DB interface}

\subsection{The overall picture}

Berkeley DB is an \jargon{embedded database}.  This implies the library
provides access to a file containing one or more database tables.  The
Berkeley DB database tables are always binary, mapping a \jargon{key}
to a \jargon{value}.

Accessing a database consists of four steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialise the DB environment using db_init/1.  This step
          is optional, providing simple non-transactional file access
	  when omitted.
    \item Open a database using db_open/4, returning a handle to the
          database.
    \item Accessing the data using db_put/3, db_get/3, etc.
    \item Closing a database using db_close/1.  When omitted, all
          open databases are closed on program halt (see at_halt/1).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Opening a database}

\begin{description}
\predicate{db_open}{4}{+File, +Mode, -DB, +Options}
    Open a file holding a database. \arg{Mode} is one of \const{read},
    providing read-only access or \const{update}, providing read/write
    access.  \arg{Options} is a list of options.  Currently supported
    options are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{duplicates}{bool}
    Do/do not allow for duplicate values on the same key.  Default is
    not to allow for duplicates.
	\termitem{database}{Name}
    If \arg{File} contains multiple databases, address the named
    database in the file.  A DB file can only consist of multiple
    databases if the db_open/4 call that created it specified this
    argument.  Each database in the file has its own characteristics.
        \termitem{key}{Type}
    Specify the type of the key.  Allowed values are:
	\begin{description}
	    \termitem{term}{}
	Key is a Prolog term (default). This type allows for
	representing arbitrary Prolog data in both keys and value.  The
	representation is space-efficient, but Prolog specific.
	See PL_record_external() in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual for
	details on the representation.
	The other representations are more neutral. This implies they
	are more stable and sharing the DB with other languages is
	feasible.
	    \termitem{atom}{}
	Key is an atom.  The text is represented using the character data
	and its length.
	    \termitem{c_string}{}
	Key is an atom.  The text is represented as a C 0-terminated string.
	    \termitem{c_long}{}
	Key is an integer.  The value is represented as a native C long in
	the machines byte-order.
	\end{description}
        \termitem{value}{Type}
    Specify the type of the value.  See \const{key} for details.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


\subsection{Accessing a database}

The predicates in this section are used to read and write the database.
These predicate use a \arg{Key} and a \arg{Value}. These should satisfy
the key and value-types specified with db_open/4. If a value is declared
using the type \const{term} (default), arbitrary Prolog terms may be put
in the database.

If a non-ground term is used as \arg{Key}, it is matched using
\jargon{structural equivalence}. See \predref{=@=}{2} in the SWI-Prolog
reference manual for details.  For short, if a term \term{a}{A,B} is
used as key, it will only be found using a key of the same format: a
term with functor \const{a} and two unbound arguments that are not
shared.

\begin{description}
\predicate{db_put}{3}{+DB, +Key, +Value}
    Add a new key-value pair to the database. If the database allows for
    duplicates this will always succeed, unless a system error occurs.
\predicate{db_del}{3}{+DB, ?Key, ?Value}
    Delete the first matching key-value pair from the database.  If the
    database allows for duplicates, this predicate is non-deterministic.
    The enumeration performed by this predicate is the same as for
    db_get/3. See also db_delall/3.
\predicate{db_delall}{3}{+DB, +Key, ?Value}
    Delete all matching key-value pairs from the database.  With unbound
    \arg{Key} the key and all values are removed efficiently.
\predicate{db_get}{3}{+DB, ?Key, -Value}
    Query the database.  If the database allows for duplicates this
    predicate is non-deterministic.
\predicate{db_enum}{3}{+DB, -Key, -Value}
    Enumerate the whole database, unifying the key-value pairs to
    \arg{Key} and \arg{Value}.  Though this predicate can be used with
    an instantiated \arg{Key} to enumerate only the keys unifying with
    \arg{Key}, no indexing is used by db_enum/3.
\predicate{db_getall}{3}{+DB, +Key, -Value}
    Get all values associated with \arg{Key}.  Fails if the key does
    not exist (as bagof/3).
\end{description}


\subsection{Transactions}			\label{sec:transactions}

Using the DB transaction protocol, security against system failure,
atomicy of multiple changes and accessing a database from multiple
writers is provided.

Accessing a DB under transactions from Prolog is very simple.  First
of all, the option \term{transactions}{true} needs to be provided to
db_init/1 to initialise the transaction subsystem.  Next, the predicate
db_transaction/1 may be used to execute multiple updates inside a
transaction.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{db_transaction}{1}{:Goal}
Start a transaction, execute \arg{Goal} and terminate the transaction.
{\bf Only} if \arg{Goal} succeeds, the transaction is \jargon{commited}.
If \arg{Goal} fails or raises an exception, the transaction is
\jargon{aborted} and db_transaction/1 either fails or rethrows the
exception.

Of special interest is the exception

\begin{quote}
\term{error}{\term{package}{db, deadlock}, _}
\end{quote}

This exception indicates a \jargon{deadlock} was raised by one of the
DB predicates. Deadlocks may arise if multiple processes or threads
access the same keys in a different order.  The DB infra-structure
causes one of the processes involved in the deadlock to abort its
transaction.  This process may choose to restart the transaction.

For example, a DB application may define \predref{\{\}}{1} to realise
transactions and restart these automatically is a deadlock is raised:

\begin{code}
{}(Goal) :-
	catch(db_transaction(Goal), E, true),
	(   var(E)
	->  true
	;   E = error(package(db, deadlock), _)
	->  { Goal }
	;   throw(E)
	).
\end{code}
\end{description}


\subsection{Notes on signals and other interrupts}

The Berkeley DB routines are not signal-safe. Without precaution, this
implies it is not possible to interrupt Prolog programs using the DB
routines in a safe manner. To improve convinience, interrupt signals are
blocked during the execution of the DB calls. As db_transaction/1
handles aborts gracefully, PrologDB applications can be interrupted and
aborted safely.

Signals other than \const{SIGINT} caught during the execution of one of
the DB interaction predicates may leave the DB in an inconsistent state.
Fatal signals thrown by other Prolog or foreign language facilities are
handled gracefully.


\subsection{Initialisation}

Optionally, the DB environment may be initialised explicitely. Without
initialisation,	the DB predicates may be used to access a database file
without transaction support and using default caching. This is generally
satisfactory for not-too-large databases that have no strong security
demands and are accessed by at most one application in update mode.

\begin{description}
\predicate{db_init}{1}{+Options}
    Initialise the DB package.  This must be done before the first call
    to db_open/4 and at maximum once.  If db_open/4 is called without
    calling db_init/1, default initialisation is used, which is
    generally suitable for handling small databases without support for
    advanced features.

    \arg{Options} is a list of options.  The currently supported are
    listed below.  For details, please refer to the DB manual.

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{home}{Home}
    Specify the DB home directory, the directory holding the database
    files.
	\termitem{config}{+ListOfConfig}
    Specify a list of configuration options, each option is of the
    form \term{\arg{Name}}{Value}.
	\termitem{mp_size}{+Integer}
    Size of the memory-pool used for caching.
	\termitem{mp_mmapsize}{+Integer}
    Maximum size of a DB file mapped entirely into memory.
    \end{description}
	\termitem{create}{+Bool}
    If \const{true}, create any underlying file as required. By default,
    no new files are created.  This option should be set for prograns
    that create new databases.
	\termitem{logging}{+Bool}
    Enable logging the DB modifications.  Logging enables recovery of
    databases in case of system failure.  Normally it is used in
    combination with transactions.
	\termitem{transactions}{+Bool}
    Enable transactions, providing atomicy of changes and security.
    Implies \const{logging} and \const{locking}. See
    \secref{transactions}.
	\termitem{server}{+Host, [+ServerOptions]}
    Initialise the DB package for accessing a remote database.
    \arg{Host} specifies the name of the machine running
    \program{berkeley_db_svc}.  Optionally additional options
    may be specified:

    \begin{description}
        \termitem{server_timeout}{+Seconds}
    Specify the timeout time the server uses to determine that the
    client has gone. This implies the server will terminate
    the connection to this client if this client does not issue
    any requests for the indicated time.
        \termitem{client_timeout}{+Seconds}
    Specify the time the client waits for the server to handle
    a request.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


\section{Installation}

\subsection{DB version}

This package was developed for DB version 3.1.  The interface of
DB 3.x is fundamentally different from previous releases and db4pl
relies on functionality provided by DB 3.x.  Unfortunately many
distributions of DB are still based on DB 2.x.  Please make sure
to install DB 3.1 or later before building db4pl.


\subsection{Unix systems}

Installation on Unix system uses the commonly found {\em configure},
{\em make} and {\em make install} sequence. SWI-Prolog should be
installed before building this package. If SWI-Prolog is not installed
as \program{pl}, the environment variable \env{PL} must be set to the
name of the SWI-Prolog executable. Installation is now accomplished
using:

\begin{code}
% ./configure
% make
% make install
\end{code}

This installs the foreign libraries in \file{$PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH} and
the Prolog library files in \file{$PLBASE/library}, where
\file{$PLBASE} refers to the SWI-Prolog `home-directory'.

Configure recognises the following options in addition to the default
GNU configure options.

\begin{description}
    \longoptionitem{enable-mt}{}
Enable thread-support for the multi-threaded version of SWI-Prolog.
Currently not supported.
    \longoptionitem{with-db}{DIR}
Point to the installation-directory of DB 3.x for finding include files
and the DB libraries.  For example:

\begin{code}
./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.1
\end{code}
\end{description}
