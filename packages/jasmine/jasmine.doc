\begin{abstract}
The Jasmine interface provides a client interface to the Object Oriented
Jasmine database.  The interface consists of two layers.  The first is a
simple wrapper around the Jasmine C-interface. The second provides
utility predicates providing more high-level access to Jasmine.

\section{Introduction}

Jasmine is an object-oriented database (ODB), implementing ODQL ({\bf
O}bject {\bf D}atabase {\bf Q}uery {\bf L}anguage). It provides a
C-interface based on the following components:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Session management]
Connecting and disconnecting a database.
    \item [Variables]
Within the interface, variables can be declared.  These variables can
be manipulated both using ODQL statement and from the access language.
Variables play a vital role in communicating data.
    \item [Data conversion]
Variables can be read and written.  They are dynamically typed and the
interface provides access to their type and value.  In Prolog we can
exploit dynamic typing of Prolog to hide most of the data conversion
from the user.
    \item [Collection conversion]
Collections play a vital role in communicating results from databases.
Variables are bound to collections using ODQL statements.  They can
be queried for their size and converted into Prolog lists.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Basic ODB predicates}

Below is the definition of the basic ODB access predicates defined in
\file{jasmine.c}.

\subsection{Session management}

Sessions are accessed using a \jargon{session-handle}. This opaque
handle is normally preserved in the Prolog database.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{odb_ses_start}{5}{-SH, +Database, +User, +Passwd, +EnvFile}
Connect to the indicated database and return a handle for the created
session in \arg{SH}. \arg{SH} is an opaque Prolog term providing context
for subsequent ODB calls. \arg{Database} specifies the database to
connect to.  It is an atom formatted as below, where \arg{nvode} is the
name of the machine to connect to.  \arg{User} and \arg{Passwd} and
\arg{EnvFile} are either atoms or unbound variables.  The latter makes
the interface choose default values.  \arg{EnvFile} is the name of a
file providing parameters for the interface. See the C-API documentation
for details.

\begin{quote}
    [\arg{vnode}::]/jasmine/jasmine
\end{quote}

    \predicate{odb_ses_end}{1}{+SH}
Terminate the session. Note that at_halt/1 can be used to ensure
termination of the session when Prolog halts.
\end{description}


\subsection{ODQL Statements}

ODQL statement are passed in textual form and specified either as atoms
or SWI-Prolog strings. The latter makes it possible to construct
statements using sformat/3.  See also odb_exec_odql/3.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{odb_exec_odql}{2}{+SH, +Statement}
Execute the given ODQL \arg{Statement} on the session \arg{SH}.  This
predicate either succeeds or raises an exception. See
\secref{exceptions} for details.
\end{description}


\subsection{Variables}

Variables play a vital role in the interface.  Interface variables are
defined using ODQL statements. They are scoped to the session, but
otherwise global.  There are two approaches to deal with this.  One is
to define a suitable set of variables for the application at startup
and the other is to create them as they are needed.  In the latter case
one should be sure the variable name is currently not in use.  In some
of the examples we therefore see:

\begin{code}
undefVar pcount;
Integer pcount;
\end{code}

From this example we learn that variables are typed. The type is
accessible through the C-interface and used by the access predicate to
perform suitable conversion to Prolog.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{odb_get_var}{3}{+SH, +Name, -Value}
Fetches the value of the named interface variable. Succeeds if the value
can be unified successfully, fails if the value is retrieved correctly
but unification fails and raises an exception otherwise.

The representation of \arg{Value} depends on the type of \arg{Name} in
the database interface.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Bool]
Booleans are represented either using the atom \const{true} or
\const{false}.
    \item [ByteSequence]
Byte-sequences are represented using an atom (as of SWI-Prolog 3.3 atoms
can hold 0-bytes are therefore are capable of storing an arbitrary
byte-stream).
    \item [Date]
Dates are represented in SWI-Prolog as a floating point number
representing the time since the start of 1970. See the Prolog reference
manual for manipulating dates.
    \item [Decimal]
An ODB decimal is a sequence of digits with precision and scale. There
is no representation for this in Prolog and therefore we use
\term{decimal}{Digits, Precision, Scale}.  See the Jasmine C-API docs
for details.
    \item [Integer]
Jasmine integers are, as SWI-Prolog's integers 32 bit signed values and
therefore represented naturally.
    \item [Nil]
Nil is represented using the Prolog empty list (\const([])).%
	\footnote{This could be considered a bug. What would be a better
		  choice?}
    \item [Object]
Objects are represented using a opaque term.
    \item [Real]
Jasmine reals are double-precision floats and therefore naturally
represented using SWI-Prolog floats.
    \item [String]
Strings are, like \type{ByteSequences}, represented as Prolog atoms.
    \item [Tuple]
Database N-tuples are represented using a term
\term{tuple}{...\arg{Arg}...}, where \arg{Arg} is the converted value
for the corresponding position in the tuple.
\end{itemlist}

    \predicate{odb_set_var}{3}{+SH, +Name, +Value}
Set a variable.  In accordance with the guidelines in the interface this
first fetches the value to examine the type of the variable.  The latter
is problematic, as not-yet-filled variables yield the \jargon{Nil} type.
In this case the type is determined from \arg{Value}.

This translation currently does not deal with the type-ambiguities. It
is currently not possible to set nil-variables to a boolean,
byte-sequence or date. This problem can be fixed by using an ODQL query
to fill the empty variable with an object of the requested type.
\end{description}


\subsection{Collections}

Database queries normally yield collections as results.  The interface
simply converts collections into Prolog lists.  The current interface
does not yet provide mechanisms for fetching part of a collection. Note
that, using ODQL statements it is possible to get the length of a
collection before conversion:

\begin{code}
collection_length(SH, Collection, Length) :-
	odb_exec_odql(SH, 'Integer len;'),
	odb_exec_odql(SH, 'len = ~w.count();', [Collection]),
	odb_get_var(SH, len, Length).
\end{code}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{odb_collection_to_list}{3}{+SH, +Collection, -List}
Where \arg{Collection} is the name of a variable containing a collection
or the object-identifier of a collection. The elements of the collection
are converted using the same rules as odb_get_var/3.
\end{description}


\section{Utility Predicates}

The predicates of the previous section provide all important aspects of
the C-API to the Prolog user. The provided access however is very
low-level.  A very first start has been made to provide a number of
utility predicates.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{odb_exec_odql}{3}{+SH, +Format, +Args}
First constructs a command using sformat/3 from \arg{Format} and
\arg{Args} and then execute it.
    \predicate{odql}{3}{:SH, +Declarations, +Statements}
Utility to deal with a sequence of ODQL statements, requiring some
variables to execute them.  \arg{Declarations} is a list of
\arg{VarName}:\arg{Type}.  These variables are first unset and then
declared using the given type.  Please note that this principle is
{\bf not re-entrant}.  \arg{Statements} is a list containing a mix
of ODQL statements, set/get variables, access collections and ordinary
Prolog code:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{get}{VarName, Value}
Fetch the interface variable \arg{VarName} using odb_get_var/3.
    \termitem{set}{VarName, Value}
Store the interface variable \arg{VarName} using odb_set_var/3.
    \termitem{get_list}{Collection, List}
Get a variable or object-id into a list of values using
odb_collection_to_list/2.
    \termitem{\{\}}{Goal}
Call normal Prolog goal in the module from which odql/3 was called.
Note that \exam{\{Goal\}} is the same as \term{\{\}}{Goal}.
    \termitem{-}{Format, Args}
Execute an ODQL query using odb_exec_odql/3.
    \termitem{\arg{Command}}{}
Execute ODQL command.
\end{description}

Here is an example, extracting the available \jargon{class-families}
from the Jasmine database:

\begin{code}
families(SH, List) :-
	odql(SH,
	     [ ss:'Bag<String>'
	     ],
	     [ 'ss = FamilyManager.getAllFamilies();',
	       get_list(ss, List)
	     ]).
\end{code}
\end{description}


\section{Error handling}		\label{sec:exception}

All errors are reported using Prolog exceptions.  This package raises
two types of exceptions.  If Prolog arguments cannot be converted into
the desired data, normal Prolog \const{type_error} and
\const{instantiation_error} exceptions are raised. Jasmine calls
returning an error are translated into an error term of the format

\begin{quote}
    \term{error}{\term{package}{jasmine, ErrorId}, Context}
\end{quote}

Where \arg{Context} is

\begin{quote}
    \term{context}{Message, _}
\end{quote}

In this term, \arg{ErrorId} is the (numerical) error identifier raised
by Jasmine and \arg{Message} is Jasmine's textual representation of the
error. 


\section{Issues}

The interface defined here provides the foreign-language basis for a
more advanced Prolog ODQL interface.  Specifying all ODQL as
strings and dealing with the interface variables is not a desirable
way to deal with ODQL.  A more fundamental approach is to define a
Prolog API for ODQL and an interface for translating these Prolog
queries into textual ODQL calls.  For example, the families/2 example
above could be written as:

\begin{code}
families(SH, Families) :-
	odql(Families:bag(string) = 'FamilyManager'.getAllFamilies).
\end{code}


\section{Installation}

The jasmine package has currently been build only on Windows. As Jasmine
is also available on Unix, the standard SWI-Prolog package
infra-structure for Unix foreign packages is provided.

\subsection{Unix systems}

Installation on Unix system uses the commonly found {\em configure},
{\em make} and {\em make install} sequence. SWI-Prolog should be
installed before building this package. If SWI-Prolog is not installed
as \program{pl}, the environment variable \env{PL} must be set to the
name of the SWI-Prolog executable. Installation is now accomplished
using:

\begin{code}
% ./configure
% make
% make install
\end{code}

This installs the Prolog library files in \file{$PLBASE/library}, where
\file{$PLBASE} refers to the SWI-Prolog `home-directory'.

\subsection{Windows}

Run the file \file{setup.pl} by double clicking it.  This will install
the required files into the SWI-Prolog directory and update the
library directory.
