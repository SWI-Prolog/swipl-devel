# This program is used to generate the configure script from
# pl/src/configure.  This script also generates Makefile
# 
# To use it, first edit the PKG variable in Makefile.in 
# defining the packages to build.  Then run
#
#	./configure
#	make
#	make install
#
# If you also plan to use pl-mt (the multi-threaded version of SWI-Prolog),
# you should pass the option --enable-mt to configure.  The resulting
# packages work both with the single-threaded and multi-treaded SWI-Prolog.
