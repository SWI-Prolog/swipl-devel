  * FIXED: time:remove_alarm/1 for MS-WIndows.  Mike Elston.

 * ADDED: Make library(time) suitable for multi-threaded operation.

 * ADDED: library(rlimit) for accessing POSIX process limits

 * ADDED: tcp_setopt(Socket, dispatch(false))

Jun 20, 2002

   call.

29/04/2002
  
 * Add initialization to load_foreign_library for calls lacking this.
   Holger Kanwischer.

28/03/2002

 * Record position on socket-streams (SIO_RECORDPOS).

 * Many changes to library(socket): fixes for the Windows implementation,
   dispatch events during tcp_read() while waiting for input.

01/02/2002

 * Modified copyright for compatibility with the now LGPL SWI-Prolog system

07/12/2001

 * FIXED: memory_file_to_atom/2 and friends to return size 0, empty atom
   when the file contains no data.

10/06/2001

07/10/2000
 
 * ADDED: Allow for descriptor to arguments of dup/2.

   Form-data if SWI-Prolog is installed as a CGI script.

06/04/1999

 * Renamed the predicates from the socket package to tcp_<their-old-name>.
   These predicates are meant as low-level primitives and their normal name
   is too general.
