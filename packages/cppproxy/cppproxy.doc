\begin{abstract}
This document describes an infrastructure for calling Prolog from C++
that allows for controlled access from C++ based on a generated
\jargon{proxy} class. In our first target the proxy class talks to a
multi-threaded Prolog server using TCP/IP sockets. In future versions
this will be extended with SSL sockets, pipes and native DLL embedding.
The C++ and Prolog sourcecode for all these scenarios is identical,
except for the code that initialises the system.

\section{Introduction}

SWI-Prolog is well suitable for writing a wide range of complete
applications without introducing other languages into the system and an
even wider range when linking C/C++ coded shared objects to access
external resources, in real-life Prolog is often embedded in systems
written in other languages. The reasons vary. Re-use of existing code,
expertise in the development team or external requirements are commonly
encountered motivations.

Embedding Prolog is not a logical choice in our view. An important part
of the power of Prolog can be found in its development system where
retrying goals and reloading patched code on the running system speedup
development considerably. In embedded system these features are often
lost or severely limited due to lack of access to the interactive Prolog
toplevel or inability of the rest of the application to stay
synchronised with the dynamic nature of the Prolog part of the
application.

If you have to embed there are several options for doing so, each with
specific advantages and disadvantages.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Linking as library]
Linking Prolog as a library is attractive as it allows for two-way
communication at very low overhead. It is also the most complicated
approach, often loosing access to the Prolog toplevel entirely,
introducing possibly threading and (on POSIX systems) signal
synchronisation problems, link conflicts and difficulty to localise
bugs.

    \item [Using pipes]
By using anonymous pipes between the hosting system and Prolog we
introduce a seperation that makes it easier to localise problems and
reliably stop and start Prolog. The price is -again- loosing the Prolog
toplevel, slower communication and pipes only provide a single
communication channal.

    \item [Using sockets]
Using sockets connecting to a continuously running multi-threaded Prolog
server does keep access to the Prolog toplevel, offers very short
startup times and allows to distribute the applications over multiple
hosts on the network.  The price is that it is way harder to setup
the communication (something must ensure the server is running and 
allocate a port for it) and the server must be written thread-safe.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Overview}

This packages consists of the following components:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [ Interface definition ]
The library \file{cpp_interface.pl} and \file{typedef.pl} define
directives that allow you to specify the predicates that are callable
from C++ and their types. Only specified predicates can be called and
only with matching types. Restricting what can be called greatly
improves security when used in a server setting.  \Secref{itfdecl}
describes these declarations.

    \item [ Code generation ]
The library \file{cpp_codegen.pl} defines the code generator. The code
generator is used to create the C++ source for a proxy class that is
used in the C++ client to talk to Prolog.  \Secref{codegen} describes
generating the C++ proxy.

    \item [ Prolog server ]
When using sockets, the library \file{cpp_server.pl} defines the
Prolog server.  See \secref{server} for details.

    \item [ C++ client library ]
The file \file{SWI-proxy.cpp} and \file{SWI-Proxy.h} provide the
base classes for the client proxy.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Related techniques}

The technique used in this package are not new nor unique.
Inter-language communication has been a topic in ICT for a long period,
resulting in various widespread and well established solutions. The
power of this solution is that it is tailured to Prolog's features such
as non-deterministic predicates, lightweight, simple and fast. The
weakness is of course being bound to Prolog and, currently, C++. Proxy
generators can be defined for other languages, reusing most of the
infrastructure except for the details of the code generation.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [CORBA]
CORBA generates language specific proxies from a language neutral (IDL)
specification. There are no bindings for Prolog. We once wrote a proxy
generator between the C++ proxy and Prolog. This design is fairly
elegant and produces fast interprocess communication.  CORBA however
is a complicated big system that require considerable resources for
doing even the smallest tasks.

    \item [HTTP (optionally with SOAP)]
Using the Prolog HTTP server is another alternative.  HTTP provides the
basic message \jargon{envelope}. The message content is still undefined.
SOAP (an XML based content format) can be used here.  Backtracking over
solutions is hard to implement based on the stateless HTTP protocol.
The approach is much more complicated and the various protocol layers 
require much more data and processing time.  Experience show latency
times of approx.\ a few milliseconds, where our server shows latency
times of approx.\ 0.1 millisecond (AMD 1600+, SuSE Linux).

    \item [InterProlog]
InterProlog is a stream-based connection to Java.  I have no experience
with it.

    \item [SWI-Prolog C++ interface]
Using the native SWI-Prolog C++ interface does not provide network
transparency and is much harder to program.  The advantage is that it
allows for mutual calling, more threading alternatives and many more.
\end{itemlist}

\subsection{Prolog Portability}

The design can work with other Prolog systems. The server exploits
multi-threading, but with some limitations this can be changed to run in
a single thread. The proxy generator is portable with some effort and it
is also possible to generate the proxy with SWI-Prolog and use it with
a server written in another Prolog system. The proxy itself is pure C++,
knowing nothing about Prolog.


\section{Defining the interface}
\label{sec:itfdecl}

The interface definition defines the C++ callable predicates as well as
their types and modes. The interface only deals with ground terms. The
type language syntax is defined in the library \file{typedef.pl}
and is based on the Mycroft/O'Keefe type language.

\begin{description}
    \directive{type}{1}{TypeSpec}
If \arg{TypeSpec} is of the form \mbox{\arg{Alias} = \arg{Type}},
\arg{Alias} is an alias for the type named \arg{Type}. If \arg{TypeSpec}
is of the form \mbox{\arg{Type} {\tt\string->} \arg{Def}}, \arg{Def} is
the definition of \arg{Type}. Polymorphism is expressed using multiple
definitions seperated by the \verb$|$ (vertical bar) symbol.%
\footnote{The design allows for limited polymorphism, but this is not
yet part of the current implementation.} A single definition is a term
whose arguments define the types of the arguments.

There are three \jargon{primitive} types: \const{integer}, \const{float}
and \const{atom}.
\end{description}

Valid type declarations for our C++ interface do not use polymorphism
and a fully expanded type definition consists of structures and
primitive types.  The argument \emph{names} for compound types are
derived from the type-name and usually bound to a real type using
a type-alias.  Here is an example:

\begin{code}
:- type first_name = atom.
:- type last_name  = atom.
:- type age        = integer.

:- type person -> person(first_name, last_name, age).
\end{code}

The callable predicates are specified using the library
\file{cpp_interface.pl}, which defines two directives.

\begin{description}
    \directive{cpp_callable}{1}{Head [= Attributes], ...}
Defines \arg{Head} to be callable from C++.  \arg{Head} has the same
number of argument as the predicate that must be callable.  Each
argument is of the form +\arg{Type} or -\arg{Type} for resp.\ an
\jargon{input} and \jargon{output} argument.  \arg{Attributes} is
a list of attributes.  Currently defined attributes are:
\begin{description}
    \termitem{one}{}
Predicate succeeds exactly ones. Failure is an error. If the predicate
succeeds non-deterministically the choicepoints are discarded (cut).
Such predicates are mapped to a \ctype{void} method on the C++ proxy
class. If the predicate fails this is mapped to a C++ exception. This is
the default.

    \termitem{zero_or_one}{}
Predicates fails or succeeds ones. If the predicate succeeds
non-deterministically the choicepoints are discarded (cut).
Such predicates are mapped to an \ctype{int} method on the C++ proxy
class returning \const{FALSE} if the predicate fails and \const{TRUE}
if it succeeds.

    \termitem{zero_or_more}{}
Predicate is non-deterministic.  Such predicates are mapped to a
subclass of class \class{PlQuery}.

    \termitem{as}{Name}
If present, the predicate is mapped to a C++ method or query class
named \arg{Name} instead of the name of the predicate.  This allows
for mapping different calling patterns of the same predicate to
different C++ methods or classes.
\end{description}

    \directive{cpp_type}{1}{CName = Functor}
Specifies that the Prolog type \arg{Functor} is represented by the C++
class CName.  This allows for different naming conventions in the Prolog
and C++ world.
\end{description}

The examples below depend on the type examples above.

\begin{code}
:- cpp_callable
	version(-atom) = [one],
	find_person_younger_than(+age, -person) = [zero_or_more].

version('0.0').

find_person_younger_than(MaxAge, person(FirstName, LastName, Age)) :-
	person(FirstName, LastName, Age),
	Age =< MaxAge.
\end{code}

\section{Compound data as seen from C++}
\label{cppcompound}

Compound data that is to be communicated to Prolog is represented as
a C++ class.  This class must provide methods to fetch the components
for use as a predicate input argument and with a method to create fill
an instance of this class for predicate output arguments.  These methods
are:

\begin{description}
    \cfunction{void}{initialize}{t1 a1, t2 a2, ...}
The initialize method is called with as many objects of the proper type
as there are arguments in the Prolog term.  The primitive types are 
\ctype{long}, (for Prolog integers) \ctype{double} (for Prolog floats)
and the C++ \jargon{std} class \ctype{string} for atoms.

    \cfunction{Type}{get_\textit{field}}{}
For each named field (see \secref{itfdecl}) a function must be provided
that extracts the field and returns the appropriate type.  For atom
typed fields the return value can be an std \ctype{string} or a 
plain C \ctype{char*}.
\end{description}

Below is a possible implementation for the above defined person class.

\begin{code}
class person
{ 
public:
  char *first_name;
  char *last_name;
  int age;

  person()
  { first_name = NULL;
    last_name = NULL;
    age = -1;
  };
  ~person()
  { if ( first_name ) free(first_name);
    if ( last_name ) free(last_name);
  }

  char *get_first_name() const { return first_name; }
  char *get_last_name() const  { return last_name; }
  long  get_age() const  { return age; }

  void initialize(string fn, string ln, long years)
  { if ( first_name ) free(first_name);
    if ( last_name  ) free(last_name);

    first_name = strdup(fn.c_str());
    last_name  = strdup(ln.c_str());
    age = years;
  }
};
\end{code}

\section{Generating the C++ proxy}
\label{sec:codegen}

The C++ proxy class is automatically generated from the Prolog
declarations using the library \file{cpp_codegen.pl}.  To generate the
code load this library in a Prolog process that has all the
cpp_callable/1 and type declarations in place and invoke the predicate
cpp_server_code/2:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{cpp_server_code}{2}{+File, +Options}
Generate the C++ proxy class to access the deterministic predicates and
the query classes for the non-deterministic predicates and write them
to the given \arg{File}.  \arg{Options} consists of

\begin{description}
    \termitem{server_class}{Name}
Name of the proxy class.  If omitted it is called \ctype{MyProxy}.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\section{Using the proxy classes}

\subsection{Passing primitive datatypes}

Primitive data are the Prolog types integer, float and atom.


\subsection{Passing compound data}

Compound data is represented as a compound term in Prolog and, unless
renamed using cpp_type/2, an equally named class in C++.


\subsection{Non-deterministic queries}
\label{sec:ndet}

The proxy for a non-deterministic predicates is a subclass of
\ctype{PlQuery}. The name of the class is the name of the predicate,
unless modified using the \term{as}{Name} attribute with cpp_callable/1.
A query is started by creating an instance of this class using a pointer
to the proxy as argument. The only method defined on this class is
::next_solution(). This method uses the same arguments as the proxy
methods that represent deterministic queries.  The following example
fetches all functors with arity 3 defined in Prolog:

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(typedef)).
:- use_module(library(cpp_interface)).

:- cpp_callable
	current_functor(-atom, +integer) = [zero_or_more].
\end{code}

\begin{code}
#include <iostream>
#include "myproxy.h>

int 
main(int argc, char **argv)
{ MyProxy proxy("localhost", 4224);

  try
  { between q(&proxy);
    string name;

    while ( q.next_solution(name, 3) )
    { cout << name << endl;
    }
  } catch ( PlException &ex )
  { cerr << (char *)ex;
  }

  return 0;
}
\end{code}


\subsection{Nesting queries}
\label{sec:nestquery}

Non-deterministic queries are initiated by creating an instance of its
class. The query is said to be \jargon{open} as long as the query object
is not destroyed. New queries, both deterministic and non-deterministic
can be started while another query is still open.  The \jargon{nested}
query however must be closed before more solutions can be asked from
the query it is nested in.

The example below computes a table of all square roots for the numbers
1 to 100 using prolog to generate the numbers on backtracking using
between/3 and access to sqrt/2.  First the Prolog code, followed by
the C++ code.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(typedef)).
:- use_module(library(cpp_interface)).

:- cpp_callable
	between(+integer, +integer, -integer) = [zero_or_more],
	sqrt(+float, -float).

sqrt(In, Out) :- Out is sqrt(In).
\end{code}

\begin{code}
#include <iostream>
#include "myproxy.h>

int 
main(int argc, char **argv)
{ SqrtProxy proxy("localhost", 4224);

  try
  { between q(&proxy);
    long l = 1;
    long h = 100;
    long i;

    while ( q.next_solution(l, h, i) )
    { double ifloat = (double)i;
      double rval;

      proxy.sqrt(ifloat, rval);
      cout << "sqrt(" << i << ") = " << rval << endl;
    }
  } catch ( PlException &ex )
  { cerr << ex;
  }

  return 0;
}
\end{code}


\section{Running the server}
\label{sec:server}

For running the server we need a Prolog process with the actual
predicates and their declarations loaded.  We load the library
\file{cpp_server} and invoke cpp_server/1:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{cpp_server}{1}{+Options}
Start the C++ server in the current process.  This creates a small
thread with the alias \const{cpp_accept} that accepts new connections
and, for each new connection, starts a new thread that handles the
queries for the client. Options include:
\begin{description}
    \termitem{port}{Port}
Port on which to bind the server.  Default is 4224.
\end{description}
\end{description}


\section{Putting it all together: a complete example}
\label{sec:example}

The base-classes for the runtime system are installed in the SWI-Prolog
include directory as \file{SWI-proxy.cpp} and its header
\file{SWI-proxy.h}. These files are \emph{not} compiled into a library.
Considering compatibility between different compilers and compilation
models (threading, etc.) it is thought to be easier to include this code
into the target project using the source-code.

The directory examples (installed as
\file{.../pl/doc/packages/examples/cppproxy}) contains some stand-alone
examples as well as a \file{README} explaining how to compile and run
the examples.


\section{Status}

The current implementation is a demonstrator. Issues to be resolved in
future versions of this package include

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Handle arrays]
Provide automatic conversion of C++ arrays and/or std library vectors
to Prolog lists. Currently sets can be extracted from Prolog by
enumerating a non-deterministic predicate and send to Prolog using
repetitive calls.  Both imply sending many small packages over the
wire.

    \item [Authentication and security]
Currently the server is `wide open', Limiting the IP for connecting
hosts is a first step. Other steps are login using password
challenge/response. Sequence numbers to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks
and the use of SSL.

    \item [Alternative communication channals]
Currently only the TCP/IP version is implemented.  See introduction.

    \item [Error recovery]
Protocol errors (which can be caused by incompatible proxy and Prolog
server type declarations) crash the connection. Re-synchronisation is
difficult to implement.  We could do a version check by computing a
hash from the Prolog interface specification and validate this on
communication startup.
\end{itemlist}


\subsection{Portability}

The system is designed to be portable using any modern C++ compiler. It
has been tested on Linux using g++ 3.3.4 and MS-Windows using MSVC 6.


\section{Installation}

\subsection{Unix systems}

Installation on Unix system uses the commonly found {\em configure},
{\em make} and {\em make install} sequence. SWI-Prolog should be
installed before building this package. If SWI-Prolog is not installed
as \program{pl}, the environment variable \env{PL} must be set to the
name of the SWI-Prolog executable. Installation is now accomplished
using:

\begin{code}
% ./configure
% make
% make install
\end{code}

This installs the foreign library \file{serialize} in
\file{$PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH} and the Prolog library files in
\file{$PLBASE/library} and the files \file{SWI-proxy.cpp} and
\file{SWI-proxy.h} in \file{$PLBASE/include}, where
\file{$PLBASE} refers to the SWI-Prolog `home-directory'.

\subsection{Windows system}

If you have successfully installed the system from source you can
install this package using

\begin{code}
% nmake /f Makefile.mak
% nmake /f Makefile.mak install
\end{code}

If not, compile serialize.c using the command below and install the
files by hand or using the makefile after setting the variable PLBASE
to the base of the installed Prolog system.

\begin{code}
% plld -o serialize serialize.c
\end{code}

\printindex
