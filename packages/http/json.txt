---+ Supporting JSON

From  http://json.org, "
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines
to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses
conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of
languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and
many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
language."

JSON is interesting to Prolog because using AJAX web technology we can
easily created web-enabled user interfaces where we implement the server
side using the SWI-Prolog HTTP services provided by this package.
The interface consists of three libraries:

    * library(http/json) provides support for the core JSON object
      serialization.
    * library(http/json_convert) converts between the primary
      representation of JSON terms in Prolog and more application
      oriented Prolog terms.  E.g. point(X,Y) vs. object([x=X,y=Y]).
    * library(http/http_json) hooks the conversion libraries into
      the HTTP client and server libraries.
