This is a simple demo of the  HTTP server facilities, providing a simple
body and the three documented server instantiations.

The server main programs are:

	# demo_threads.pl
	Run threaded server. Requires SWI-Prolog with thread-support.
	The server is started at port 3000 using server/0.  server/2
	allows to specify options. tm/0 provides a graphical display
	of the runing threads.  See source-file. 

	# demo_xpce.pl
	Run XPCE-based event-driven server.  Requires XPCE.  Use
	?- server(3000). to start the server at port 3000.

	# demo_inetd
	To install this, adjust the first line of this file to point
	to the installed Prolog executable and add the following line
	to /etc/inetd.conf (adjust as needed):

	4001 stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/lib/pl-5.1.4/library/http/demo/demo_inetd

	# demo_client.pl
	Simple multi-threaded client to test the server under
	different conditions.  Requires SWI-Prolog with thread-support.
	See source for usage.
