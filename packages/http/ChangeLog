       * Instead of returning an atom representing the authenticated
       user, the hook must deliver a list of options that is added to
       the request.  The new API allows for multiple authentication
       hooks on the same location.  It is used by PlDoc to provide host
       access control.  See doc_access.pl from the PlDoc package.

   becomes ambiguous after integrating http_path.pl with the handler
   declarations.
