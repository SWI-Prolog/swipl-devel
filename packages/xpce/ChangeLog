[VERSION 4.8.0]

* Introduced class `pixmap'.  Basically an image of <-kind: pixmap.  The
  explicit class facilates type specification and conversion.

* Moved `dialog_item ->apply' and `dialog_item ->restore' to class graphical.

* Added: `text <->border', providing additional space around a text object.

* Replaced `text <->transparent' by `text <->background', allowing for
  arbitrary background.  `text <->transparent' is mapped on this new
  method for compatibility reasons.

* Added: `bitmap <->transparent' to define bitmaps with non-rectangular
  shape.  Added this as a second optional initialisation argument.

* Modified resource-syntax.  Resources now use a syntax very similar to
  the Prolog syntax for objects.  For example:

  	Pce.Dialog.gap:		size(10,10)

  Old-style resource specifications are still handled, but raise the
  error `old_resource_format'.  You can use this error (by default just
  prints a warning) to locate incompatibilities or invoke:

  	?- send(error(old_resource_format), kind, ignored).

  to stop the system complaining.  The resources Pce.Display.font_families
  and the font-family implementing resources do *not* convert the old
  format.  As these will not very often be redefined by the user, this
  should be an acceptable burden.

  The reason for this is to allow for specification of resource-values
  for ambiguously typed resources.  For example, type colour|image makes
  translating a name ambiguous (either a colour-name or an image-file
  name).  In the new system, you may use `colour(red)' and `image("pce.bm")'.

  See `resource <-convert_string' for details on the new syntax.

* Class resource changes:

	# deleted: `resource <-obtained'
	A resource is not obtained if its <-value equals @not_obtained
	(a constant)

	# added: `resource <-convert_string'
	Converts the string-value read from the `resource <-default' or
	the X11 resource system in to a value satisfying the <-type.

	# Added: @resource_parser
	This global object parses resource specifications.

* Modified resource inheritance.  Resource definitions with classes need no
  longer to be redefined at each sub-class to be able for the user to
  modify the resource.  The system takes care of refinement of resources
  when necessary, while sharing as much as possible of the data-structures.
  Lookup of resources has been speeded up drastically.

* Improved colour-handling:
	- Allow (window) background to be both an image or a colour.
	- Allow graphical colour to be both image or a colour.
	

* Added `timer ->delay' to allow suspension of the XPCE process in a
  host-independant fashion.

* Redraw now maintains multiple update-areas.  This change has provides
  an incredible speed-up for some applications.	 The infra-structure
  has been set-up for further advanced redraw planning in the future.

* Library naming.  The libraries pce_drag_and_drop.pl and
  pce_drag_and_drop_dict_item.pl have been renamed in dragdrop.pl
  and dragdict.pl to satisfy DOS naming conventions.

* Frame OPEN/CLOSE/ICONISE issues.  The port to MS-Windows made it
  desirable to clean-up the various interacting methods dealing with
  opening, iconising, mapping, etc. of frames.  All is now handled
  by the central method <->status.  `Frame <->show' and <->iconic
  are mapped onto this new method for compatibility reasons.  
  `Frame ->mapped', invoked from the X11 interface has gone.  The
  most likely usage of this method is to wait for a frame to be
  open.  This functionality is now realised by the new method
  `frame ->wait'.

* Implemented MS-Windows-3.1 version of the `Virtual Window System
  Interface'.  See source directory msw.  Additional methods for the
  MS-Windows implementation: `@pce ->console_label' and `@pce
  ->expose_console' to manipulate the console window.

* Complete reorganisation of C-source directory structure and Makefiles.
  Aim: simplify installation, reduce Unix dependency and limit filename-
  length requirements.

* Definition of class stream as a superclass for socket and process to
  share the details of asynchronic communication.  Will probably be
  integrated further.

* Virtual Window System Interface now includes the classes display and
  cursor.  For class display, this implies that some old `hacks' are
  no longer possible.  To determine the display is open, use
  `display <-opened' instead of `display <-slot: display_xref'.  The
  depth of the display is requested using `display <-depth'.  The old
  hack `display <-slot: depth' no longer works as this slot has disappeared.

  Vanished slots on class display are: display_xref, shell_xref, root_bitmap,
  pixmap_context, bitmap_context, depth, white_pixel, black_pixel,
  foreground_pixel, background_pixel and colour_map.  All this data is
  not private to the X11 inplementation of the Virtual Window System
  Interface.

* Modified: `text_buffer <->character' now fails if the index is out of the
  range of the text-buffer

* 8/16 bit version of text-representation classes

* Added: `string ->insert_character'


[VERSION 4.7.2]

* Added: overview of delegation to ClassBrowser.

* Added: library('man/behaviour_item') for entering XPCE behaviour references
  using completion.  Used by PceEmacs for M-x manpce and M-x editpce and
  by the manual card-browser for a `goto' field.

* Modified: `@emacs->server_start: Force:[bool]': Added `force' argument.
  When not @on, the server will only be started if no server exists.

* Fixed: ensured call to `window<-resize_message'

* Fixed: removed errornous error-message from `node->son' to make this
  method succeed without side-effects if the son-relation is already true.

* Compatibility: Fixed initialisation of `style <-colour' when loading old
  files.

* Fixed: trees using multiple-inheritence (e.g. directed graphs with a single
  source) did not handle `collapsed' nodes correctly.

* PceEmacs: fixed using selection as default value when prompting for files.

* More QP integration stuff: renamed emacs.pl and demo.pl into pce_emacs.pl
  and pce_demo.pl.  Some more initialization directives.

* Added: menu <->vertical_format to control the vertical alignment of items
  in their box.

* Fixed: unalloc() regex `fastmap' on ->unlink.  Fixes memory leak on
  optimised (regex ->compile: @on) regular expression objects.

* Added: `menu ->members' to set the <-members of a menu with one message.

* Added: `editor ->styles' to associate a new style-sheet with an editor.

* PceEmacs: make server windows `sticky', redefine \C-x# to mean `quit'
  for non-server windows and kill-buffer-and-return-server for server
  windows.

[VERSION 4.7.1 (PW-3 1.1 == 4.7.1 including a few patches from 4.7.2)]

* Modified Makefile to avoid the macro C++, which is refused by many
  versions of make.

* Added Makefile-i486-linux and friends for linking to Linux 1.0 (tested
  using the Slackware 1.2.0 distribution).

* (re)integration of SICStus interface: added prolog/boot/pce_expand.pl.
  this file is supposed to be loaded *first*.  the module pce_host is
  supposed to define property/1 describing some aspects of the Prolog
  system.
  
  XPCE/SICStus still does not run due to a bug in SICStus 2.1#8.  An
  fix has been promised by SICS for 2.1#9.

* Added: PceEmacs `fundamental_mode ->goto_line'

* Fixed: list_browser search as called by the text-item completion
  function.  Caused a name-table inconsistency if completion was
  requested without initial value, there was no common prefix to the
  extensions and the user tried to search the list_browser ...

* Fixed some minor problems in the reference-manual generation software
  and some group-inconsistencies.  Minor updates to the reference manual.


[VERSION 4.7.0]

* Fixed: reporting of `unresolved' types by checkpce/0 for types which
  context class has an autoload declaration.

* Modified: Default font-set generation.  See Pce.Display.font_families
  and `display ->load_fonts'.  See also README.font

* Fixed: `event ->is_a' for 8-bit characters.

* Fixed: Serious name-table hash-performance degradation, generally
  occurring with more than about 7000 XPCE names.

* Modified: Visual-hierarchy: added `dict' between `browser' and
  `dict_item'.  This is both conceptually clearer and drastically improves
  the speed of ->destroy'ing large browsers.  Browsers are now tested to
  be really fast upto 25.000 items on a SPARC-II.  

* Modified: graphical <->fill_pattern now also accepts a colour argument:
  send(Box, fill_pattern, colour(green)) make the *interior* of the box
  green.

* Fixed: Various bugs in image objects of <-kind: pixmap, notably
  colour handling: proper handling of <-background and <-foreground,
  proper opening and association with a display, proper read and write
  of individual pixels.

* Added: `visual <-container: class|code': find enclosing visual that
  satisfies condition.

[VERSION 4.6.15]

* Fixed: `window ->typed' when nested in a decorator (pictures).  This method
  handles global menu-bar accelerators.

* Added: `object ->unlinking': test if object is currently beeing unlinked
  (freed).

* Fixed: added global declaraction for @default_syntax_table.

* Added: graphical ->_redraw_area.  Allows plain graphicals to be displayed.

* Fixed: declaration of return-type of `regex <-register_value'.

* Modified: `device ->compute' no longer clears the bad_format variable
  if there is no attached format (internal).

* Added `text ->margin: Width wrap_fixed_width' which is like `wrap',
  but the <-width of the text (as a grapical) is fixed to margin value.

* DELETED `text_item ->caret' and introduced `graphical ->keyboard_focus'.

* Integration of keyboard-input for list_browser and editor: definition
  for _wants_keyboard_focus, ->next and related methods.

* MODIFIED: (list_)browser <-selection FAILS is there is no selection
  AND the multiple_selection equals @off.  Earlier releases returned
  @nil in this case.  Code written as

	get(Browser, selection, Selection),
	(   Selection == @nil
	->  bla bla

  Will have to REWRITTEN.  Most source will be unaffected however.

* Manual Tools, History menu fixed for groups containing a class
  (no-behaviour error).

* Fixed: `file ->find' for `refinding' a file from a restored object.
  Fixes bug in reloading image objects from files (file <-object) if
  the absolute pathname has changed since the ->save_in_file.

* Added: Prolog module pce_host (Prolog implementation binding):
	- callable_predicate(+Module:Head)	True if can be called
	- modified_since_last_loaded(+File)	True if file has been modified

* Fixed: ClassHierarchy: error message when asking menu on a leaf-node.

[VERSION 4.6.14]

* Restructuring of Prolog libraries:
	- Added dialog editor tool
	- Calling of dialog editor and emacs from the manual-tool menu
	- New Prolog libraries:
	* make_dialog.pl: make_dialog/2: Realise dialog built using
	  Dialog Editor.
	* pce_image.pl: pce_image_directory/1: declare a new image directory
	* pce_helper.pl: Application help-system.
	* pce_tagged_connection.pl: Connection with a tag in the middle.

* Added: `source_location <-convert' to allow editing files using
  send(@emacs, edit, 'hello.pl').

* Fixed: class <->resource if the class was not yet ->realised

* Reorganisation to prepare ports:
	- Converted to fully prototyped ANSI C.  Fixed some minor
	  bugs in the course of doing this.
	- Defined abstract window-system interface for the classes
	  window and frame.  X11 implementation thereof.

* Improved QP compatibility together with Mike Vines (AIIL): added
  :- initialization where needed, autoload definition, various
  misplaced :- meta_predicate declarations, etc.  Requires
  SWI-Prolog 1.8.9 or later to run (improved quintus.pl library).

* Fixed: drag_and_drop gestures under mwm Window-Manager

* Solaris patches:
	- Fixed starting inferior processes in PceEmacs
	- Fixed M-x manual_entry for other sections (man -s)


[VERSION 4.6.13]

* Fixed: path->initialise_new_slot to call graphical->initialise_new_slot
  (Fixes saved-object conversion for class path).

* Changes library(pce_postscript) for Quintus compatibility.

* Fixed: `key_binding->typed' when invoking a method accepting more than
  2 arguments.

* Avoid a number of useless messages to the completer of class text_item.

* Fixed: `frame ->expose' to properly set <-show: @on.

* PceEmacs: ensure that deletion of the window works (doesn't really
  quit emacs; just ->show: @off it).  By default does not show the buffer
  menu.  Added show_buffer_menu to the file menu.  Fixed `reload'
  after trapping modified buffer.  Indicate modified buffer in title
  bar of window.  Added more `window-pools', Added pool to ->identify,
  etc.


[VERSION 4.6.12]

* PceDraw: fixed: clear modified on save.

* Moved `dialog_item <->active' to the level of class graphical.  Graphicals
  that are inactive are greyed-out and not sensitive to events (unless
  the ->event method is redefined).

* Fixed: `picture ->open' if the picture had been opened before, but was
  closed using `frame ->show: @off'.

* Changed: `dialog_item <->reference' handling.  Slot-value @default now
  computes the <-reference when requested.  Otherwise the value is
  returned.  Also improved alignment of class menu_bar.

* Fixed: drawing a bitmap of <-kind: pixmap onto a bitmap with <-kind:
  bitmap.  Maps all pixels in the source foreground to 1 and background
  to 0.  All other colours yield an undefined result.

* Added: optional `times' argument to `string->newline'.

* Changed: handling of absolute paths for class file.  The aim is to
  arrive at better portable load/save facilities.  The <-name attribute
  remains in the original specification (i.e. including ~ and or $var).
  ->absolute_path writes the <-path variable and leaves the <-name
  unchanged.  See class file for details.

  This fix should make file-related saved image objects portable to
  machines on which xpce is installed in a different place.

* Fixed: Class menu for <-on_image == @nil and <-off_image \== @nil
  (crash).

* Fixed: load/save of syntax_table objects on machine with different
  byte order representation (PC/Linux).  Declared save_style of this
  class `external'.


[VERSION 4.6.11]

* Tracer: when the tracer prompts for a value, possible pointer-grabs
  are released first.  Avoids hanging, notably when the tracer traps
  an error after a display ->inform

* The method `frame->fit' is now always called using normal message
  passing.  This allows for redefinition of this method in applications.

* Fixed: replaced ln -sf in install by rm -f ; ln -s

* Fixed: ranlib entry in makefile for systems lacking ranlib

* Fixed: `fragment->overlap' if the argument is a fragment or point
  (yielded incorrect results).

* Fixed: Syntax error on unx-directory.c for solaris.

* Fixed: C++ include files now define As... as `inline'.

* Fixed: Realising the event-type hierarchy when the tracer is on.


[VERSION 4.6.10]

* Added: `fragment ->emptied' which is called by class text_buffer if
  the fragment is emptied as a result of deleting text.

* Added: `fragment ->delete' for compatibility with class string.

* Fixed: regex->for_all: include type `fragment' (implementation could
  already handle fragments).

* Fixed: view, editor: copy obtained size resource!

* Added: `graphical <-popup', complementing `graphical ->popup'.

* Added: <-clone and ->save_in_file hooks for class editor.

* PceEmacs: M-x manpce now handles descriptions such as class->method,
  etc.

* Fixed: `text_item ->enter' now invokes ->typed: id, @on on its <-device
  in order to properly handle default buttons with nested dialogues.
  
* Fixed: delCodeReference() testing for freeing object.  This should FIX
  CRASHES IN ALLOC() recently reported.

* Added: `function ->convert_loaded_object' to allow objects to be loaded
  in debug-mode that contain functions.

* Added: `variable <-return_type' for consistency with class get_method.
  Changed: `variable <-argument_type' fails if variable has no send
  <-access.

* Changed: `list_browser ->show_label: @on' default label is no longer
  `Untitled', but <-label_name of `list_browser <-name'.

* Fixed: Crash in redrawing list_browser.  It is unclear whether the
  errornous status could only be reached on a reloaded (using `file <-object')
  list_browser or that normally created list_browsers could be affected
  by this bug too.

* Added: `object <-clone' interface for the classes text_image and
  list_browser.

* Added `vector->append: value ...', store value(s) from <-high_index + 1

* Added `dict->members', doing ->clear and ->append members of chain to
  the dict.

* Added: `directory <-directory: name': return (sub)direcectory.

* Fixed: incompatibility in loading object-databases with hypers created
  with version 4.6.7 or older.

* Added: save/load (object ->save_in_file) facilities for class list_browser
  and class text_image.

* Added: AsChain(), etc. types to C++ interface (see C++/demo/dir.C).  Fixed
  lazy creation of the host instance (for XPCE/C++ stand-alone programs).

[VERSION 4.6.9]

* Installation: replaced ln -sf by rm -f followed by ln -s for compatibility
  with BSD ln versions.

* Modified: PceEmacs: Paste while a prompter is active now pasts the
  value in the minibuffer rather than at the caret in the window.

* Added: `text ->insert' to insert text (by default at <-caret).

* Fixed: stop flagging the online manual database to `modified' after
  inspecting a user-defined class.

* Fixed: ClassBrowser search with scope : `sub'. Bug was introduced by
  the changed semantics of `class <-sub_classes' in 4.6.3.

* Fixed: IMPORTANT: improper handling of reference-counting by local
  variables.  Temporary code objects that include assign statements
  could upset reference-counting.  This caused unpredictable crashes in
  searching the online manual and after switching buffers in PceEmacs.

  This fix is extremely important for the XPCE/Lisp interface as
  !setq is translated into an assign object.

* Fixed: PceEmacs refusing to switch modes under some conditions.

* Changed: portray_object/2: types are 'portrayed' by their name.

* Fixed: reference to freed object in PceEmacs miniwindow prompter.

* Fixed: figure: redraw of outline/background on changes to the internals.

* Fixed: spypce(Class <-Selector): avoid evaluation of the implementing
  function.

* Added: PceEmacs: ->drop and ->preview_drop to include sources from the
  dialog editor.

[VERSION 4.6.8]

* Added: drag_and_drop_dict_item_gesture to the online manual list-browsers
  that allow dropping methods to the (experimental) graphical activation
  model of dialog windows.

* Added: library file pce_drag_and_drop_dict_item.pl, defining the class
  drag_and_drop_dict_item_gesture for drag-drop dict-items from a
  list_browser.

* Modified library file pce_drag_and_drop.pl for better extensibility.
  New features: <-warp to switch between putting the cursor in the
  center of the dragged object and not-moving the pointer.  Also,
  ->get_source defines a function on the graphical to determine the
  object dropped.  See library files and demo programs.

* Added: `dict_item <-position' to compute the location of a dict-item
  on the associated list_browser object.

* Fixed: error reporting for incompatible slot-value in saved objects
  (file <-object).

* Errors: fixed error id redeclared_reference (called by
  `object ->name_reference') to produce a sensible text.

* Class-compiler: give warning on non-ground type-specifiers.

* Fixed: SERIOUS BUG in class window_decorator.  Caused send(new(picture),
  open) to crash on PC/Linux pl14 (any maybe other OS/compiler combinations).

* Object save/load: added `variable <-save_style' (completeness).  Fixed
  `variable <-save_style: nil' interpretation by `object ->save_in_file'.
  This fixes a bug in storing cyclic structures containing attribute-links
  with save_style `nil'.

* Fixed: Positioning of popup-menu's on windows when the window is scrolled.

* Fixed: PceEmacs: dangling `emacs_mode <-editor' references after
  switching mode and deleting the window.

* Changed: `connection ->indicate' now passes the event object instead
  of the position as a point.  Fixes linking to specific handles when
  using `cross-device' connections.

* Added `key_binding <->condition': general condition to accept events
  as for class gesture.

* Added `event <-key' to get key-description from event as used by class
  key_binding.

* Object ->save_in_file: hyper-relations are only stored if both ends are
  stored.  Based on new (rudimentary) support for save/clone using
  `relation-semantics'.  This will be further extended in the future, but
  for the moment it allows using hyper-objects to objects that are subject
  to the save-mechanism.

* Fixed: `type <-kind: member': translation now verifies argument-type before
  calling <-member on the context.  Improves error-response on methods
  with argument-type `member:<something>'.

* Fixed: load library(pce_selection) in Inspector.  Avoids trapping
  undefined method `display ->copy' and properly exports the selected
  object to the X11-selection.

* Added Pce.TextItem.search_ignore_case resource to make completion on
  value-sets case-insensitive (default).

* Added (simple) detection for creating cyclic structures in trees.  Cyclic
  trees crash the layout algorithm.

* Fixed: line (with <-arrows) PostScript generation if the <-pen of the
  line is different from the pen of the arrow.

* Type syntax: <int>.. and ..<int> are now accepted as ranges ``from
  <int> to @pce <-max_integer'' and ``from @pce <-min_integer to <int>''.
  Added to some slots, but should be added to many more.

* Added: `function ->send_super' and `class ->install'.  Made
  `code ->execute' and `function <-execute' accessible for user-defined
  methods.  This together allows for user-defined executable (code) classes.

* Class message and ? (obtain): execution now evaluates the receiver the
  same as the arguments.  This implies that

	message(XYZ?something, '_instance_of', class)

  will evaluate the obtainer (once) before starting '_instance_of'.  This
  only effects messages if the selector is defined on class function or
  below and the receiver is a function.  As the previous definition was
  rather useless it is unlikely to effect compatibility.

* Fixed: redraw of menu-label with <->layout: vertical and <-label_format
  is right or center.

* Slider: grab focus on button-down.

[VERSION 4.6.7]

* Fixed: update menu layout on dynamically changing `menu_item <-label's.

* Fixed: `menu->execute' for menu's that have no <-members.

* Fixed: `menu ->clear' when menu is not displayed.

* Fixed: `frame ->append' if the frame is already mapped.

* VisualHierarchy tool: fixed typing integer references to the text_item.

* `device ->layout_dialog' and `dialog ->layout' now discard dialog
  items that have <-displayed: @off.

* Added: `char_array <-delete_prefix'

* Fixed drawing line of text_item 1 pixel outside the area.

[VERSION 4.6.6]

* Fixed generation of .../xpce/src/files to include pce-inline.o, itf-C.o
  and gnu-getdate.o.  This should make the LispWorks installation work again.

* checkpce/0: Added checking whether all forward declarations of types
  are actually backup-up by a class-definition or an autoload definition
  for the class.  Also, if this is not the case the system won't crash
  anymore while accessing the unresolved type.

* Fixed ClassHierarchy-tool `Expand Tree': recent class reorganisation
  defines that `class <-sub_classes' either fails or returns a chain.
  In older versions an empty chain was returned.

* Made first argument of `text_item ->initialise' optional.  Allows for
  show_key_bindings(text_item) to display the key-binding table for an
  instance of class text_item.

* Added `text ->prefix' to allow for multikey sequences in text_item and
  other non-editor based editing.  ->prefix was delegated to the <-string.
  Using the new meta-key encoding for 8-bit support this resulted in an
  error when ESC was typed to a text_item.

* Modified FontViewer demo to display all characters of a character-set.

* Added quick hack to allow for handling 8-bit input (so we can handle
  full ISO-Latin-1 character sets): Meta-key no longer generates event-codes
  <value+128>, but event-codes <value+65536>.  They key_binding table
  `insert' maps the entries 128..255 onto ->insert_self.

  COMPATIBILITY: event-handlers using numeric values to specify
  meta-<key> will no longer work.  Please replace such specifications
  by symbolic ones:

	  handler('M-c', message(...))

  handles meta-c.  In most cases class key_binding provides a better
  replacement of the out-dated handler class.  Code using key_binding
  objects is fully compatible.

* Added library-file prolog/lib/pce_font_item.pl implementing class
  font_item: a compound-dialog-item for selecting fonts.  See comments
  in the file.  Class font_item is now used by PceDraw too.

* Fixed memory-leak in handling functions: executing functions left a
  reference, protecting functions for the garbage-collector after they
  had been evaluated.

* Fixed button recompute when changing <->popup on a displayed button.

* Added PostScript generation for class text when ->margin is active.

* Added `menu->sort' to sort the list of menu-items and update the
  menu afterwards.

* Fixed rounding in `text ->length' to ensure the text can actually hold
  the requested number of `ex'es.  This also fixes short text_items.

* Fixed *serious* bug in `object <-clone'.  This bug appears on variables
  that have a `named' type that represents a class.  The clone and original
  will share the value of such slots and the reference-count will not be
  maintained correctly.

* GCC-2.5.x/SunOs-4.1.x: Fixed declarations for strtod().

* Fixed: slider->redraw (OpenLook style): was drawing 1 pixel outside the
  area.  Only a problem when moving sliders.  Also fixed sliders which
  range includes negative values and ensured proper update on changing
  various slider attributes.

* Fixed: `device ->layout_dialog': offset problem if the left-side of the
  device was not the origin of the window.

* Added `menu_item ->value: value, [label]'.  Changes value *and* label,
  just like ->initialise.  COMPATIBILITY: changing the value now also
  changes the label!

* Fixed superfluous redraw when displaying text_item objects.  Notably
  speed-up of making dialog windows.  

[VERSION 4.6.5]

* Fixed area computation of class menu.  Only caused problems for
  overlapping dialog-items.

* Fixed: `menu->kind: cycle' with `menu <-look: open_look' now switches
  the <-pen to 0.

* Fixed: `button ->default_button' to force redraw on change.

* Added: `figure ->{border,radius,shadow}' to manipulate the outline of
  the figure.

* Modified `device ->advance' (controlling the caret notably in dialog
  windows) to exploit the device hierarchy.

* Fix class list_browser default-size: the default size of a list-browser
  depended on resizing other list-browsers.

* PceEmacs: fixed trapping the `Browse' menu when trying to find a
  non-existing tag (emacs_language_mode ->find_tag).

* Added `dialog_item ->name' to update <-name and recompute the default
  label.  This method calls `dialog_item <-label_name' to compute the
  default label.

* Modified object->send_vector and object <-get_vector: attempt to convert
  vector argument (Allows for passing in functions).

* Redesign of object-initialisation:

	- Replaced `variable <-initial_value' by `variable <-alloc_value' and
	  `variable <-init_function'.
	- `object ->initialise' now initialises variables and resources
	- Added type := initial_value syntax to Prolog class parser.

  NOTE: the functionality of these things are still subject to further
  changes.  The aim of these changes is to simplify object-creation and
  to make initial and default values explicit (i.e. move them from the
  code level to the meta-level).

* Cloning: set clone_style of `behaviour <-context' to `reference' and from
  class type to `none'.  This patch is necessary for the experiental
  class-template stuff.

* Fixed `event <-inside_subwindows' (X11 error when the pointer was not
  over an XPCE window).  Fixed drap_and_drop_gesture error message.

* `@pce ->syntax': realises all classes before modifying the syntax.
  This patch is necessary for the LISP interfaces.

[VERSION 4.6.4]

* Allow list_browser <-dict to be @nil (i.e. have a browser without
  an associated dict.  `Dict ->free' may now be invoked also if the
  dict is displayed in a browser (used to crash). [sorry, this patch
  didn't make it in the Linux version yet].

* Added `Mailing List' option to the file menu of the online manuals
  for (un)subscribing to the mailing list.

* Added `chain ->nth0' and `chain ->nth1'.  Fixed description of
  (outdated) `chain ->current' method.

* Version 0.2beta release of the C++ interface:
	- Added 'pceloadc++'/[1,2] in prolog/boot/pce_pl.pl
	- Added pl/src/pl-crt0.c: incremental-linking `crt0.o'
	- Added pl/src/mangle.c: mangle C++ __CTOR_LIST__ and friends to
	  avoid multiple definition conflicts when linking C++ code with
	  global constructors.
	- Changed linker-flags for SWI-Prolog to drop -r -static (linux)
	- Changed @pce<-machine to hold the complete machine description
	- Added ..../xpce/include: C++ include files and friends
	- Tested on: SunOs-4.1.3/g++-2.5.4/make/gnu-m4
		     Linux-0.99.13/g++-2.4.5/gnu-make/gnu-m4
 	- Documentation: .../xpce/man/C++/*
			 ftp.swi.psy.uva.nl:/pub/linux/doc/C++/*
	- Demos: .../xpce/C++/demo
	- Skeleton Makefile: .../xpce/C++/demo/Makefile

* Added `function ->_name_reference' to allow for renaming functions
  rather than the thing they point too.

* Documented `chain ->move_before' and `->move_after'.

* [INTERFACE].  Added pceReInitialise(int argc, char *argv[]).  Languages
  that create a saved state should call pceInitialise() as before when
  the state is created and pceReInitialise() after a saved-state is
  reloaded.  Needed for interfacing to plain C++.

* Fixed `@pce ->bench' for invokation-style `invoke'; did not actually
  call the code n times ...

* Fixed memory-leak when invoking a host-defined vararg method.  Also
  realised speedup of this by added special-purpose creation/destruction
  functions for the code_vector object used to pass the argument-vector.

* Added `@pce <-method_calls' (statistics).

* Changed `regex ->for_all' to accept (optional) `from' and `to' arguments
  to substitute in range.

* Fixed creating example cards in the online manual,

* Added `directory <-file'.

[VERSION 4.6.3]

* Integrated SGI/IRIX-4.0.5F port (using gcc-2.4.5) from Fred Kwakkel:
  Renamed the irix md and makefiles to conform the new naming schema,
  added pl/src/Makefile-sgi-irix-4 and fixed ioctl() problem in
  src/unx-process.c

* Added `variable <->initial_value: any|function' to initialise slots
  automatically.  This feature is currently only used by the C++ class
  definition interface.

* Added class `create' to create objects using functions (i.e. as part of
  an (compound) PCE code object).

* Fixed `device <->{position,x,y}' to ->compute the device first. 
  Undisplayed devices (also class figure) yielded wrong results.

* Fixed `window ->catch_all' to take care of frame-defined methods when
  there is a <-window_decorator, but no frame yet.

* Fixed type of `device ->resize'.

* Fixed `expression <-value'.  Errors (failing functions) were not reported
  and caused all subsequent calls to this method to fail.  For error-reporting
  on functions, the method `function ->_error' is added.  Corresponding
  changes to the internal function errorPce() and the arguments of
  `error ->display'.

* Implemented pre-alpha C++ interface.

* Made creation of built-in classes dynamic.  See `class <->realised'.  As
  a consequence the start-up time is reduced for host-languages that cannot
  create a saved state *after* initialising xpce.  Initial memory consumption
  is reduced from about 1 MB to 0.5 MB.


* Added support for full 8-bit character sets: modified all char values to
  be unsigned using gcc's -funsigned-char.  Fixed gnu-regex.c for proper
  extending the sign.  Fixed dimension computations in xwn-draw.c for
  incomplete fonts (also speedup of font stuff).


[VERSION 4.6.2]

* Switch off Prolog tracer (actually SWI-Prolog, but mostly relevant to XPCE)
  before calling Prolog's on_halt() hooks to avoid recursive tracing while
  trying to get out.

* Fixed source-location registration so that for Prolog-defined classes
  <-source now always works properly.

* Fixed PceEmacs `emacs_buffer ->revert' and added revert to the file menu.

* Moved geometry-management of the classes browser, view, editor and
  list_browser to use the ->request_geometry mechanism.  This should
  remove inconsistent handling of various geometry request methods.
  These objects (like any other object) may be addressed in pixel
  units using `graphical ->do_set'.

  COMPATIBILITY: Old code that used broken methods may now result in
  very large windows.  Width and height of these classes is now always
  represented in character units!

* Added `@display <->quick_and_dirty' to choose between speed and correct
  drawing.

* Fixed changing the busy_cursor on an existing frame.  See
  `frame ->busy_cursor'.  Detected block_events=@off argument not to
  work.  This may turn out to be practically impossible using X11.


VERSION 4.6.1

* Fixed `frame <-return' when the return value is an integer.

* Added `class ->record_instances' and `class <-instances' to keep track
  of created instances.

* Added `frame ->busy_cursor' to switch the cursor temporary for all
  subwindows of a frame and `display ->busy_cursor' to do the same for
  all PCE frames in a display.  The latter is automatically used to switch
  the cursor to a watch while clicks and popups are executed.  See
  `click_gesture ->terminate' and `popup ->execute'.

* Fixed `graphical <-postscript' for not-displayed graphical objects by
  invoking `graphical ->compute' to the graphical before generating
  PostScript.

* Moved the automatic layout-system of class dialog to the
  super-class device.  Effectively this adds `device ->append_dialog_item'
  and `device ->layout_dialog' to the system, enabling `sub-dialogues'.

* Added graphicals to the automatic layout system of dialog windows.
  See `graphical ->above', etc.

* Added `@pce <-save_version' to get the version number used to tag
  saved-objects (was already documented but not implemented).

VERSION 4.6.0

* Fixed bug in tracer that causes a segmentation fault if XPCE is in
  trace-mode and the selector of a method is a function object.  The
  latter is used by the ClassBrowser tool, so running the classbrowser
  when XPCE was is tracemode could cause a crash.

* Fixed and documented `event <-inside_sub_window' to take care of
  window_decorators properly.

* Fixed undefined method (<-create_member) in PredicateBrowser.

* Fixed `window ->event': if the window had a <-popup, this was shown
  instead of posting the right_down event to the contents first.

* Fixed `fragment <-sub'.

* Fixed `window_decorator ->request_geometry' to take care of the <-tile.

* Fixed `window ->create' to take care of the <-pen properly (causes problems
  in the unlikely case that the window geometry is not changed while the
  frame is created).

* Changed printf()'s in `file <-object' into proper PCE errors:
  failed_to_convert and bad_slot_value.   This allows for silent loading
  of old (incompatible) object structures.

* Added menu-bar to PceEmacs windows to make them usable for novice
  users.

* Fixed `window ->normalise' when argument was a chain of objects that
  *can* be converted into graphicals (like node objects).

* Changed VisualHierarchy to normalise on expanded fields.  This avoids a
  lot of scrolling.

* Fixed drawing boxes for pen = 0, radius > 0 and fill_pattern != @nil.

* Added `list_browser ->reset' to restore the cursor after a crash.

* Fixed `menu_item <-default_label' when a graphical object is supplied.
  (not-closed argument list).

* Fixed menu_bar <-member to check for the `popup<-name' instead of the
  (translated) <-label of the popup menu.  This ensures the popup can
  be requested with the same name as it was created.

* Added `bitmap ->unlink' for proper unlinking of the <-image.  Fixes
  (mostly harmless :-) dangling references from images.

* Fixed error generated by exec() in class process to cannot_start_process.

* `key_binding' now checks type of the return value of <-interactive
  argument and generates a no_argument error in case of mismatch.  Avoids
  trapping the PCE tracer when an incorrect argument is returned.

* `text_item ->complete' now verifies the event_id to be a printable
  character before calling ->insert_self on the object if completion
  is not possible.  Avoids trapping the tracer when ->complete is
  bound to an event that cannot be inserted in the text.

* Implemented fully transparent interface to the X11 selection server.
  See `display <-selection' and `display ->selection_owner' for details.
  Modified class editor to use these (see prolog/boot/pce_editor.pl).
  Also modified the Inspector and VisualHierarchy tools to publish
  the selected object using the X-selection server.
  This avoids the need to redefine selection handling in other X11
  applications for proper interaction with XPCE.

* Implemented OpenWindow compatible look-and-feel:

	- Added Pce.OpenLook to the distribution.  This file may be
	  appended to Pce or ~/.Xdefaults to use XPCE in OpenLook
	  mode.
	- Added `button <->popup_image' to indicate presence of popup
	- `dialog_item <->alignment' replaces `dialog_item <->align_in_column'
	- Added `dialog_item <->label_format' to align the labels
	- Added DialogItem.label_suffix to ensure a label suffix (:)
	- Added `dialog_item <->look' for general switches on look-and-feel
	- Added `popup <->margin' to modify the popup layout.
	- Redesign of class menu_bar to use buttons
	- Changed class scroll_bar redraw and event handling.  Added
	  scroll-unit `line', also to class window, editor and list_browser.
	  Switches on the <-look attribute.
	- Fixed pen != 0 in menus
	- `menu ->kind: marked and choice' both map on feedback: box
	  if <-look is open_look.

* Added <->shadow to class box and class ellipse.  Added `graphical
  ->initialise_new_slot' to initialise the shadow slot of the new
  classes with 0.  Incremented SAVE_VERSION.  Added shadow to PceDraw
  and the PostScript generation methods for box and ellipse.

* Added `menu ->feedback' to switch the feedback style of existing
  menus.

* Fixed `real <-convert' for conversion from textual values.  Bug
  (returning wrong value) probably only existed on SunOs 4.x.x due
  to missing prototype.

* Class timer now first executes the message before setting up the next
  interval.  This avoids the system to `hang' due to to many timer events.

* Added `pce <-answer_stack_size'.  Changed the implementation of the
  answer-stack to reduce garbage on this stack.  Avoids quadradic
  (time) behaviour on some types of loops.   Performance problem is
  completely solved.  There is still a little garbage left on this stack.  

* Added breakpce/1 and nobreakpce/1 to break on PCE methods like
  tracepce/1 and notracepce/1.

* Fixed `frame <-postscript' if the frame is partially outside the
  screen.

* Added in prolog/lib:
	- Overview		Short overview of the library
	- tmw_geometry_box.pl
	- twm_resize_button.pl
	- subframe.pl		Define frames-in-windows

* Fixed new(X, real(0)) crash as reported by Ben Rabau (ISL).  For this
  purpose I added the interface function pceToCReference() that is
  similar to pceToC(), but only works on true PCE objects and always
  returns a PCE_ASSOC or PCE_REFERENCE.  Fixed pl_new() to use this
  function.

* The geometry-changing gestures (move, resize, move_outline and
  resize_outline) now use `graphical ->do_set' to bypass the new request
  branch PCE's geometry management.

* Added: display ->draw_in to draw directly on the root window of the
  display and display ->grab_server to temporary grab the server. May
  be used by dragging gestures who'se operation is not window-bound.

* Added Pce.Window.cursor resource for specifying the default window
  cursor (top_left_arrow).

* Fixed size of help window in PceDraw.

* Fixed `vector ->shift' garbage collection interaction.  This (internal)
  method caused problems with `editor ->kill' and friends.

* Added switch_to_buffer (\C-xb) to PceEmacs fundamental mode.

* Added the `type <->kind: value_set'.  Allows a type to define a member
  of a set of object.  The set may be generated by a function object.

* Changed `key_binding <->receiver' relation to use hyper objects instead
  of slot references.  This ensures proper behaviour on deleting the
  receiver of the key_binding (keybindings are reusable and should thus
  be preserved).  The inconsistency reported before by checkpce/0 was
  harmless.

* Fixed destruction of windows.

* Fixed `Quit' in online manual, Visual Hierarchy Tool and Inspector Tool.
  All tools can now freely be created/quited, recreated, etc.

* The methods `graphical ->device' and `graphical ->displayed' are now
  called internally as true methods, thus allowing the user to redefine
  these methods.  See class graphical.  The message passing system has
  been enhanced with a `Quick And Dirty' version of the send() operation,
  that checks quickly whether a method has been redefined and bypasses
  most checks if this is not the case.  QAD-send() has 1/3 of the
  overhead of a normal send if nothing has been redefined.

* Moved virtual method `window ->modified_item' to class device.  Fixes
  displaying dialog items on generic devices.  Bug reported by Ben Rabau.

* Modified send() not to report a freed object if the selector is `free'.

* Major redesign of class window and cleanup of scrollbars.

	- Introduction of class window_decoration: a window holding
	  the scrollbars and window-level labels.  This turns these
	  into ordinary graphical object, getting rid of a lot of
	  specialised code and update bugs.  Allows redefinition
	  of many things from the host language instead of only from C.

	  *COMPATIBILITY*
	  The code is as good as possible compatible.  However:

	  `window <->radius' is gone as the drawing plane now uses
	  the X11 window border and X11 does not support windows with
	  rounded corner (at least not as I want to have them).

	  `Window <->display_position' and `Window <->display_size'
	  have gone.  These (rarely used) methods are replaced by the
	  normal geometry-management.

	  `Window <-area' now reflects the area of the window relative
	  to the super-window or frame.  The new variable `window <-
	  bounding_box' now reflects the bounding box of the displayed
	  graphical objects.

	  There are various subtle changes.  All my testing applications
	  however run without modification.  Please report compatibility
	  problems.

	- Split geometry management for class graphical into a
	  request and action branch to allow for negotiation with
	  other objects.  See `graphical ->request_geometry' for
	  details.  No compatibility issues.

	- Cleaned the scroll_bar code, removing a lot of old and
	  no-longer used stuff.  Fixed the update code to avoid
	  calls to undefined behaviour and added a more efficient
	  schema.  See `scroll_bar ->compute' and
	  `window ->bubble_scrollbar'.

	  Added resource `Pce.ScrollBar.placement: name' which allows
	  the user to place the scrollbars right,left,top,bottom of the
	  window.

	  No compatibility issues.

	- Turned class window into a true graphical class.  Now allows 
	  for `windows on windows'.

	  *COMPATIBILITY*
	  `window <-area' now reflects the area of the window relative
	  to the parent (window or frame).  `window <-bounding_box'
	  reflects what the old `window <-area' did: the bouding box
	  of the displayed graphicals in the window coordinate system.
	  
	  `Window <->display_size', `window <->display_position' and
	  `Window <-display_area' have gone.  The normal methods
	  to handle graphical geometry now work properly.  Old bugs
	  like `window ->height' and other graphical window manipulations
	  not working properly should be fixed now.


* Fixed bug in trapping existing object references.  Added library
  pce_renew which allows you to redefine the behaviour of new/2 on
  an attempt to redefine an existing reference.  Fixed related exception
  generation.  The predicate pce_renew/1 allows you to preset how 
  existing references are handled: trace, free, rename, ask.

* Fixed bug in PceDraw yielding undefined <-mode behaviour

* Remove limit (100) of number of windows in a frame

* Renamed text_item <-print_name into <-print_name_of_value.  Overriding
  `object <-print_name' with different intention leads to poor error
  reporting on text_item objects.  Applications	that redefine this method
  should be changed.

* Added resource Pce.DrawCanvas.size resource to PceDraw which allows
  the user to specify the default size of the canvas (drawing area).

* Changed type of 2nd argument of `dialog ->append' from [name] to
  [{below,right,next_row}] and updated documentation.  No functional
  changes.


VERSION 4.5.12

* Added: class regex (regular) expression now operates on fragment objects
  too.	To support this, `fragment <-sub' is added.

* Fixed memory leak in incremental garbage collector.

* Added @editor_recogniser hook in `editor ->event', exploited by the
  new button-bindings for PCE editors defined in prolog/boot/pce_editor.pl
  Both selection and caret manipulation may now be used without modifiers.

* Fixed multiple kill-commands in editors.

* Fixed extending the selection to word boundaries in editors using double
  click to be compatible to other X applications.

* When switching to a non-existing file in PceEmacs, this file is no longer
  flagged modified.  Avoids save for accidently created buffers.

* Changed error no_x_server to `fatal' to avoid a loop in reporting the
  error.  Fixes error reporting when contacting the X-server fails.

* Improved saved-object compatibility: incremented save-version number,
  changed message on incompatible versions to use the error object
  new_save_version (default ignored), added `path ->initialise_new_slot'
  to fix `path <-offset', changed text load function to insert wrap and
  margin slots.  Fixed return type of `file <-object' to return functions
  too.

* Added `normalise' argument to `frame ->open', `window ->open',
  `frame <-confirm' and `window <-confirm'.  When @on, the window
  is repositioned to fit entirely on the screen.  Used by the
  text_item completer object to ensure the browser with possible completions
  is displayed entirely on the screen.

* PceDraw: fixed resizing selections (dangling resize boxes problem).

* Added: `text_buffer ->attach' and `text_buffer ->detach'.  These methods
  are called to update the `text_buffer <-editors' chain and may be redefined
  to monitor attach/delete of editors.

* PceEmacs miniwindow now completes on TAB too.

* Actually implemented the `sticky' indication at the bottom of PceEmacs
  windows.  PceEmacs now will reuse any `non-sticky' window for displaying
  a new file.  There are two pools of buffers: `file' and `other'.
  Tell me whether you like it!
  
* Fixed `Class Hierarchy' tool for the added `device <-find': now class
  tree inherits <-find from device instead of delegating to its <-root
  node object.

* Fixed xpce/make-bin-tape and xpce/install to properly handle the
  SWI-Prolog startup and include file.

* Added `kind' `progress' and `done' to the generic reporting mechanism
  realised by `object ->report', `visual ->report' and various other
  classes.  Provides a generic and easy interface to indicate actions
  such as loading a file to the application user.  Updated the manual
  tools to use this method.

* Added Prolog library "pce_drag_and_drop.pl", which implements the
  class drag_and_drop_gesture.

* PCE now allows for having click- and `drag' (move, connect, resize)
  gestures on the same button.  New methods for this:
  `click_gesture ->cancel', `gesture ->cancel', `event <-distance',
  `click_gesture <->max_drag_distance'.  Modified: `click_gesture ->drag'.
  By default, a click_gesture cancels after the user dragged more than
  5 pixels.

* Fixed `type <-value_set' with `type <-kind: alias'.  Used by
  `text_item ->complete'.

* Fixed trapping X11 events by class window to garbage collect the
  event after it has been processed.

* Fixed `frame ->return' `frame <-confirm' couple for proper handling
  of the return value by the incremental garbage collector.

* Fixed `image ->draw_in' to properly restore the position of the 
  graphical when a position was specified.  Now uses `graphical <->set'
  rather than `graphical <->position' for moving the graphical.  Also
  fixed when the graphical is currently displayed on a device with
  a `device <-format' attached.

* Added anonymous cursor objects that can be destroyed when `cursor <-name'
  is @nil.

* Changed `class ->clone_style_variable' and related class methods
  to accept integer slot identifier too.

* Added `device <-find' for locating graphicals similar to the
  event dispatching system.

* Added `event <-inside_sub_window' for locating events on frames and
  windows in frames.    

* Changed `graphical ->toggle_select' and `device ->selection' to
  invoke `graphical ->selected' using a message, so this message may
  be redefined.
