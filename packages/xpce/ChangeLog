[VERSION 4.10.0]

* ADDED: Classes layout_manager, layout_interface, table, table_slice,
  table_column, table_row, table_cell: Generic interface for associating
  layout managers to graphical devices and realisation of HTML-3 like
  tables (tabular layout) in this framework.

* INCOMPATIBILITIES: The old class `table', representing a relational
  database-like table has been renamed to relation_table.  Code using
  this should be modified.

* ADDED: library(pce_set_item): check for adding duplicates using the new
  method `->check_duplicate'.

* ADDED: `char_array <-strip' for deleting and cononising blank space in
  char_array objects.

* MODIFIED: library(editable_text) ->loose_focus renamed to ->release_focus
  for better consistency.

* FIXED: text objects holding an empty string now have zero-width (actually,
  2 times the <-border).

* FIXED: if a format is attached to a device, align the graphicals using
  ->do_set, rather than ->set.

* MODIFIED: `vector->element'.  `Gaps' are filled with @nil, instead of
  @default.

[VERSION 4.9.7]

[#3]

* ADDED `image<-rotate' for Windows 95.  Now uses same algorithm for NT,
  as it produces clearly better results.

* FIXED: displaying boxes with negative <-width or <-height.

[#2]

* FIXED: Displaying 3-d rectangles with radius > min(w,h)/2 (Unix/X11 version)

* FIXED: Displaying windows on tab objects (Unix/X11 version)

* FIXED: Avoid r_complement() for drawing `selection-bubbles' on graphical
  objects.

* FIXED: CtoNumber(), which could raise the error `number->initialise has
  1 argument'.  This function was incorrectly called on evaluation of
  expressions in the Windows version.  The error lead to performance
  degradation and sometimes crashes when using (for example) expressions
  on places where an integer was expected (send(Box, width, Box?height*2)).

* ADDED: -assert nodefinitions to the LDSO flags for SunOs 4.1.x, which
  sometimes incorrectly reports unresolved symbols when linking pl2xpce.so

* ADDED: Big warning in configure if -lXpm cannot be found.

* FIXED: SunOs 4.1.x/X11R4 detection of -lXpm and -ljpeg libraries failed
  due to a bug in SunOs ld.  Fixed by removing -lXt from the libraries to
  test -lXpm and -ljpeg.

* ADDED: Various libraries:

	library(pce_arrow_item)		Show/define arrow-head
	library(pce_config)		Configuration access
	library(pce_configeditor)	Edit configurations
	library(pce_graphical_browser)	Browse graphicals
	library(pce_image_browser)	Find images
	library(pce_image_item)		Show/browse image
	library(pce_set_item)		Edit set, based on editor for single

* PCEDRAW: many changes: added export of drawings as Prolog term, interface
  to the configuration library, new format for prototypes, which are now
  saved with the image, etc. etc.

* ADDED: `path ->points' and an optional additional argument to
  `path->initialise' for specifying the points as new() arguments.

* FIXED: push_operators/pop_operators to deal with op(Num, Kind, ListOfAtoms).

* FIXED: reentrance in rewindAnswerStack(), which may be caused
  by exception-handling and unlink-handling during a free invoked by
  another rewindAnswerStack().  Thanks to Heddrik van Rijn for providing
  me with a program to reproduce this error, which may leave the system 
  with an illegal answerStack, causing an infinite loop of crashes.

* FIXED: Win32 `frame->geometry' for WxH-x-y, position relative to the right
  edge of the screen.

* FIXED: Win32: realise XPCE's pallete before `image->draw_in' and
  similar operations.

* ADDED: Win32 colour garbage-collection.

* FIXED: sometimes no redraw after `button->label'

* FIXED: Various things around plain display of arrow instances: proper
  redraw when displayed on nested devices, automatic update on attribute
  changes.

* ADDED: Application configuration library: library(pce_config).  See
  PceDraw for an example.  The definition of the PceDraw configuration options
  is in library('draw/config.pl').  The personal X11 config data has been
  moved from ~/.Xpce has been moved to ~/.xpce/Xpce.

* CLEANUP: The Reference Manual database was cleaned to unreachable
  cards using `man_space ->delete_unreferenced'.

* ADDED: Class int_item: specialised text item for entering integer values
  with increment/decrement buttons.  The buttons themselves are added to
  class text_item (see `text_item ->style: stepper'), and may be used for
  -for example- ordinal scales.

* ADDED/FIXED: `arrow ->geometry', which now moves the arrow, rather than
  making it invalid.

* ADDED: `arrow->initialise': additional arguments for `style' and `fill'.

* ADDED: class label_box for making labeled dialog items consisting
  of multiple parts.  Used for the new implementation of font_item, making
  it much easier to understand.

* MODIFIED: `object->equal', and all its refinement will no longer complain
  if the argument type cannot be converted into the requested one, but simply
  fail.  So, send(colour(red), equal, point(1,3)) now simply fails.

* ADDED: `get' access to `colour<-kind'.

[VERSION 4.9.6]

* ADDED:  `colour->equal': test of two colours have the same RGB values.

* MODIFIED: Class tree in `list' mode.  A node will now display a [+]
  or [-] sign or nothing depending on the value of node <-collapsed.

* INSTALL: modified library(dialog/dialog) to avoid a call to
  pce_image_directory during compilation, and therefore the need to
  have access to the X11 display while (q)compiling the library.

* FIXED: Installation procedure for bitmaps.  New options have been
  added to install(.c): -d, -C and -pN to get much faster and simpler
  installation.

* FIXED: Scrollbar update for editors with incomplete last line.

* FIXED: `display <-font_alias' to call makeBuiltinFonts() first to
  ensure all system fonts are defined.

* FIXED: Win32 colour handling.  Properly handle colour-names case
  insensitivly.

* FIXED: 2nd argument of bitmap->initialise (transparent) was ignored.

* ADDED: Much better support for dynamically adding windows to an (open)
  frame.  See `window->above'.

* COMPATIBILITY: if a window is added to an open frame, the system now
  invokes ->resize to the frame, rather than ->fit.  This avoids the frame
  from resizing.  Code that wishes the old behaviour should look at the
  resource Pce.Frame.fit_after_append, or explicitely invoke ->fit after
  appending the window.

* CHANGED: removed obsolete `frame <-destroying' (now using ->unlinking
  to avoid recursion).

* UI: PceEmacs: added ->save_as to file menu.

* FIXED: figure ->_draw_postscript to deal properly with the <-radius of
  of the figure.

[VERSION 4.9.5]

* FIXED: Win32 box with rounded corners with radius > min(w,h)/2 was
  displayed as an ellipse.  Now displays as box with radius min(w,h)/2.

* GENERALISED: Arrow handling in class joint and its subclasses.  Any
  graphical can now play the role of an arrow-head, provided it implements
  the ->points method compatible with `arrow->points'.

* FIXED/MODIFIED: Changed first `term_name' of class window from `label'
  to `name'.  This fixes object/2 for windows that have no frame (and
  thus no implementation for <-label).

* FIXED: Area handling of thick lines (partial, handling of large arrows
  still needs to be fixed).

* FIXED: Painting arrows with non-nil fill_pattern and defined pen.

* ADDED: Various hooks to PceDraw.

* ADDED: support for user-redefinition of `graphical ->in_event_area'.

* FIXED: PostScript generation for text objects with border > 0 and
  alignment not left.

* FIXED: PostScript generation for lines with pen=0 and text objects
  holding no text.

[VERSION 4.9.4]

* FIXED: Adding windows to open frames.

* FIXED: key_binding reset of prefix and argument if a non-implemented
  key is activated.  Fixes `hanging' PceEmacs on \C-x\C-f\C-x\C-f.

* FIXED: `dialog_item ->left', etc. to configure items, appending them
  to a dialog later.

* IMPROVED: allow for user-abort while creating the manual index for the
  search tool.

* CHANGED: `Menu->update' now explicitely invokes `menu_item ->active' on
  all changed items, so this method may be redefined on class menu_item.

* FIXED: PceEmacs M-x find_tag command for better finding the line-numbers.

* FIXED: Now use hypers for dependency between PceEmacs hit-list and
  fragments.  This avoids the mark fragments from being invalidated.

* MODIFIED: `text->wrap: clip' (used by text_item) now shows the text as
  a single line, mapping \n, \r and \t to the paragraph sign, << and >>.
  Modified PceEmacs prompter handling such that Control-Q <one of the above>
  may be entered for search/replace.  

* FIXED: `window->normalise' to be prepared for (dis)appearing scrollbars.

* FIXED: PceEmacs query_replace_regex: 'n' if it was the last match.

* ADDED: Class text_item `combo-box' handling: Show drop-down indicator in
  Unix/X11 version and immediately execute ->apply after a user selection.
  See ->selected_completion for details on altering this behaviour.  Also
  see library(file_item) for an example.

* ADDED: Selection handling in text and text_item classes.  

* ADDED: Various additions to mouse-based editing:
	+ `editor ->cut_or_delete_char', bound to DEL
	+ `editor ->cut' and `editor->copy'
	+ `display ->copy' and `display->selection'
  The latter two used to be part of library(pce_selection).  This library
  will be removed.

* FIXED: PceEmacs: various improvements to input-focus handling.  This fixes
  various cases where the editor appeared `death'.

* FIXED: Win32: `window->cursor: @nil', also avoid changing the cursor if
  an XPCE cursor is changed in a window now holding the cursor.

* IMPROVED: Unix/X11 version: try even harder to get a colour.

* ADDED: Moved images from main bitmaps directory that are used by XPCE
  itself into the code, so runtime applications no longer need the bitmaps
  directory and its contents.  The new predefines images are
  @ol_pulldown_image, @ol_pullright_image, @ol_cycle_image and @pce_image
  (the default frame icon).

* ADDED: Win32: Automatic handling of the colourmap for DIB based images.

* ADDED: Reading .JP(E)G and .GIF files.  Requires -ljpeg, JPEG library
  version 6a.  Use archie on jpegsrc.v6a.tar.gz to find it on the net.
  The Win32 version now uses the same code, removing the 3rd party
  gifread and imglib libraries.

* IMPROVED: Request the X11 selection both as text and string.  Fixes import
  of selected text from ApplixWare (and maybe others).

* FIXED: PostScript generation bug in class text.

* ADDED: Win32: `frame->status: full_screen'.  The frame-status `open' has
  been replaced by `window', though the method still recognises `open' as
  a synonym.  An open window returns status `full_screen' or `window'.

* Win32: ensure popup and completion windows are displayed above the Windows
  95/NT 4.0 task-bar.

* FIXED: Completion-window is repositioned to ensure it fits on the screen.

* ADDED: Handling of (undocumented) MS_MOUSELEAVE event for Windows-NT 4.0,
  hopefully curing some old problems.

* FIXED: Colour handling drawing masked monochrome bitmap on colour device.

* FIXED: Avoid references to @manual from card-browser and visual
  hierarchy tools.

* FIXED: Deletion of the main manual tool through the window-manager.

* FIXED: `object ->delete_hypers': wrong argument order if invoked
  from the `to' object.  Also added documentation.

* FIXED: Figure/tree background setting, so dialog items and other
  graphicals using r_clear() show properly.

* FIXED: Window delegation to frame: avoid crash if no frame exists.

* PceEmacs server: Check for modified file when opening a window.

* ADDED: extra argument to `device->advance'.  All internals to call
  this as a method.  Added `tab->advance' to default the new propagate
  argument to @off.  Causes advancing in a tab to circulate, rather
  then to switch to the next (hidden) item.  Makes it possible to
  define other subclasses with this same feature.


[VERSION 4.9.3]

* IMPROVED: integer range increased to +- 2**30 (was +- 2**29).

* PORT: Various minor issues for AIX 4.1 (using gcc 2.7.2).

* UPDATED: Updated the XPCE/C++ and XPCE/Prolog/C++ installation.  Many
  improvements:

	+ Fixed and fixed for MSVC 4.2 (Win32 version)
	+ Deleted PceMethodCall (non-portable)
	+ C-interface based handling of TheDisplay, etc., to avoid
	  exporting mangled symbols (better C++ compiler independency).
	+ Replaced masking of function pointers by using a flag on
	  class method and class class to find the type of pointer
	  used to improve portability.
	+ Autoconf based configuration for the C++ interface
	+ Added installation of the interface tools to make dv-install
	+ Fixed some C++ compatibility issues in Chain.h and Pce.h
	+ Tested all demos.  Removed a few that cover issues covered
	  extensively by others.  Improved a few to look better and
	  fix C++ compatibility issues.
	+ Extended CXX/demo/README and README.CXX.  Added CXX/demo/DEMOS,
	  providing a brief overview of the demos.
	+ Changed libXPCEmain.a, now implemented in C++ by src/itf/main.cxx.
	  Exits the application if there are no more frames for which
	  events can be dispatched.

* FIXED: if the system defines on_exit(), this is preferred over atexit()
  to be able to pass the exit code to messages registered using
  @pce->exit_message.

* PORT: Linux libc 5.4.23 defines sysinfo(), which errornously is mistaken
  for Solaris (incompatible) sysinfo() by configure.  Fixed in ker/self.c by
  explicitely testing for not-linux.

* MODIFIED: `directory->scan' to send ->ignore_case to the pattern if the
  class feature `case_sensitive' on class file yields @off.  Fixes
  compatibility problems.

* INTERFACE: Various minor modifications to the SWI-Prolog/XPCE interface,
  mainly aiming at reduced memory usage and faster data conversion in the
  interface.  Saves some 10% on the interface speed.

* PW3: fixed require/1 for reporting non-existing predicates (the predicate,
  not the expansion form of require/1, which was ok).  Added support for
  index files in other library directories, so you can expand the predicates
  handled by require/1.  Added an informational message, telling which
  library index databases are loaded.

* ADDED: user:pce_post_expansion_hook/2, next to pce_pre_expansion_hook/2.

* IMPROVED: `Image ->draw_in' to provide for efficient update of the display
  if small graphicals are painted in big images.


[VERSION 4.9.2]

* ADDED: Win32: save image as XPM file.

* ADDED: Save image<-mask and <-hot_spot when writing an XPM file.

* ADDED: Documentation for pce_open/3 (see Predicate Browser).

* PERFORMANCE: Improved change combination algorithm, providing less
  unnecessary redraw operations.

* FIXED: `text_buffer <-sub', first argument didn't properly default to 0.

* IMPROVED: Modified PceDraw, such that it can be used both using 2 and
  3-button mice.

* FIXED: configure problem, not autodetecting getpwnam().  This caused
  ~user not to be recognised as a valid filename.

* ADDED: Drawing lines in tree using style `list'.

* FIXED: Selection of `Sub Class' in `Display' on ClassBrowser stopped
  finding anything if the class had no subclasses.

* DEMOS/TOOLS: Improved the image viewer a little: Use normal file-patterns
  instead of regex, and provide default extensions.

* FIXED: Configure to use MAKESHELL rather then	SHELL to define the correct
  shell.  This avoids other shells to overrun the default using the SHELL
  variable set by most user-shells.

* FIXED: Avoid colour errors.  Notably caused by Netscape running and eating
  all colours.  Both loading XPM files and allocating XPCE colour objects
  now always replace the colour value by an `as close as possible' value
  from the colourmap.

* FIXED: `display ->report: error' not to show the `cancel' button (Win32).

* FIXED: Added trapping of frame exposure to call `frame ->exposed' in Win32.
  This ensures transient windows are kept on top of the windows they are
  transient for.

* FIXED: Tab tag-width is recomputed automatically to fit the text.

* FIXED: Loading colour database appeared to miss some colours. Also added
  handling of uppercase colournames to the "Colours" demo program.

* INTERNAL: Rewrote Win32 guarding of object pretty-printer to use __try
  rather then the badly supported Win32 signal handling.

* CHANGED: Pretty Printer (used for the tracer) to print floats as
  @<ref>/<value>, to simplify debugging.

* FIXED: Dialog layout label/value alignment for a specific combination
  of `natural width' values.

* FIXED: Added hook to ensure the last_window variable in event.c contains
  a valid object.  Caused a crash under very specific circumstances.

* FIXED: `class <-super_class_name' to fail without warning on class object.

* ADDED: Win32 version: loading of .ICO and .CUR files, including mask and
  hot-spot (for cursor).  These files can be written as .XPM, to make them
  available in the Unix version.

* FIXED: Various issues concerned with displaying windows inside other
  graphicals and windows.  Modified scrolling approach in the X11 version
  to properly post a redraw request instead of redrawing immediately.  This
  should avoid useless redraw actions and avoids reentrance of the window
  redraw system (possible, but with limited nesting).

* FIXED: `line->resize'.  Used to be just graphical->resize, but this makes
  alignment errors when applied to a line.

* FIXED: `gesture ->cancel' could post the drag event to the object not
  in focus.   This could cause a drag to be received on an object that
  is not currently being dragged.

* FIXED: PostScript generation for text objects with pen > 0 and/or
  <-background attribute.

* ADDED: Pce.Graphical.event_tolerance  This resource constrolls how far
  outside very small objects, the event is considered in the object. Used
  to be a fixed value of 5.

* ADDED: `line <-distance' to accept a point argument for calculating the
  distance between a line and a point.

[VERSION 4.9.1]

* FIXED: Memory leak in alloc()/unalloc(), causing considerable leakage on
  some applications.  Also fixed a memory leak in the debugger.

* WIN32: The library uxnt.dll is now linked as a static library into the
  xpce.dll kernel, to simplify the distribution of runtime systems.

* ADDED: Win32: `frame ->icon' now defines the small icon for the system
  menu and the task-bar.  The default icon is the resource
  Pce.Frame.icon_image, which is set to pce16.xpm for the Win32 version.

* FIXED: Defining a cursor from an image and added support for XPM-image
  defined cursors for the Win32 version.

* FIXED: Accelerator assigment moved to the C-kernel, slightly improved the
  algorithm and avoided the possibility of ending in an almost infinite
  loop.

* FIXED: File->copy if the file does not exist.

* ADDED: `cursor ->initialise' to deal with XPM masked images and hotspot
  values for comfortable definition of user-defined cursors.

* FIXED: Class Real load/save and clone: ensure the F_ISREAL flag is set,
  so the host interface translates the value into a host float.

* FIXED: Graphical->displayed: @off sometimes didn't invoke the update
  mechanism properly.

* FIXED: Correction of text-width calculation for left/right bearing (X11
  version).  Only goes wrong on some weird fonts.

* FIXED: Win32: Many aspects of full colour handling: reading XPM colour
  images and specifying colours.  The system now maintains its own colour
  map in `display <-colour_map'.

* FIXED: Win32 painting arcs to update the pen.

* ADDED: Image <-rotate and Image <-clip to properly copy and/or update
  <-hot_spot and <-mask.

* ADDED: Image loading XPM files: reading the XPM's hotspot and filling
  `image <-hot_spot'.

[VERSION 4.9.0]

* PW3: Fixed generation of Manual search index.  Fixed XPCE term-expansion
  to properly support PceEmacs M-x pce_insert_require_directive.  Fixed
  errornous foreign definition in pce_principal.c.

* FIXED: RS6000: Fixed __unix__ definition, added sys/socketvar.h
  configuration, various minor patches to Makefiles and other sourcefiles.

* MODIFIED: Some details in class connect_gesture to allow for more
  advanced redefinition: ->terminate now invokes ->drag through the
  message-passer, making redefinitions of drag work properly.
  ->indicate has been modified to allow ->initiate to set the <-from_handle.

* ADDED: Class->instance_variable to allow for redefinition of variables
  with a more restricted type.

* FIXED: Area computation of class arc, sometimes missing a pixel.

* FIXED: `image ->save: file, pnm'.

* ADDED: `date ->copy'.

* ADDED: Multilevel undo in PceDraw.

* ADDED: Modal operation of frames.  See `frame ->modal'.

* ADDED: Class application.

* FIXED: Reference count management for objects having hypers, attributes,
  etc.  Caused many objects to be ignored by the incremental garbage
  collector.

* ADDED: `connection->relate' to change connections without removing
  them.

* MODIFED: `device->erase' and `graphical->device: @nil' no longer 
  modified the <-displayed attribute.

* FIXED: Binding of @class when reconsulting a file.  Make class
  directives work properly.

* MODIFIED: Handling of `chain <->current'.  The following methods no
  longer manipulate current: ->initialise, <-head, <-tail, ->swap,
  ->delete_head, ->member.

* FIXED: emacs_tags library to handle types and #defines properly (affects
  PceEmacs M-. command).

* ADDED: Class application to define a collection of cooperating windows
  as an application. Added `frame <->application' and `frame <->name' to
  support finding applications and application parts.  Also `graphical
  <-application'.

* PORT: Fixed class process handling for SGI/Irix (both compilation and
  runtime problems).  Configure has been addapted to check for the
  differences between Solaris and Irix in this respect (ioctl(tty,
  I_PUSH, "ttcompat") and the info provided with signal handlers using
  SA_SIGINFO.

* ADDED/FIXED: Added `tab ->in_event_area' test to fix event-handling and
  cursor management in tab_stack objects.

* ADDED/FIXED: Flash management.  All graphicals now define ->flash:
  [area], time=[int].  Implementation is done by inverting part of the
  window using the low-level window primitives rather then by
  manipulating the `graphical <->inverted' attribute.  The added
  area argument allows for flashing part of an object, which is exploited
  by class tab to only flash the label if it is not the top tab, and the
  whole area otherwise.

* ADDED: `dialog_group ->kind', ->border and a kind attribute to
  ->initialise.  The system now provides both boxed groups and groups
  that lack visual feedback, and may be used to define compound
  dialog objects.

* FIXED: Repaint of text objects with border and clipping (appears 
  as loosing the last character in scrolled text_item objects).

* PERFORMANCE: Better detection of changes while doing dialog layout, to
  avoid unnecessary work being done.

* FIXED: dialog_group compute management.

* ADDED: Demo: colour for (pre-)viewing the XPCE mapping of the X11
  named colour database.

* PCEDRAW: Added resources Pce.Draw.draw_fill_patterns and
  Pce.Draw.draw_colours, allowing for easy extension of these menus.

* PCEDRAW: Added automatic alignment on the basis of handle positions.

* PCEDRAW: Added automatic adjustment of the mode-menu for too many items
  or resized window.

* ADDED: On a frame resize, initiated from the user, the method `frame
  ->resize' is now explicitely called, allowing for redefinition.

* FIXED: Win32: Popup windows not to show in the Windows 95 taskbar.

* FIXED: Win32 `file->copy' (actually, worked around Win32 bug).

* FIXED: ListBrowser event handling to use the {left,middle} up events for
  their message, rather than the down event.  Fixes focus handling problems
  around cycle-menu's using the combo-box feedback (Windows).

* FIXED: Properly greying the accelerator underlining.

* FIXED: Windows 95 `socket ->append' implementation.  Thanks to Donald
  Kwakkel!

* FIXED: Win32: `display ->cut' memory allocation error if there were
  more than 1 line in the cut-buffer.

* FIXED: `host ->catch_all' to handle multiple arguments correctly
  if <-call_back is @off (message(@prolog, foo, arg1, arg2)), not using
  call-back.

* FIXED: `frame <-confirm' to return failure if the frame is destroyed.

* FIXED: Image ->draw_in: Bitmap, where Image is monochrome and Bitmap
  is coloured to avoid a crash (proper dithering still to be implemented).

* ADDED: `editor ->lost_text_buffer' to program the behaviour if the
  text-buffer of an editor is deleted.

* ADDED: @pce<-window_system.  Renamed @pce<-xt_version into
  @pce<-window_system_version and @pce<-rt_revision into
  @pce<-window_system_revision.

* ADDED: `stream ->record_separator: int' to make the socket break the
  input in fixed-size records.  The record separator may now be switched
  on open communication lines, and binary data is handled correctly by
  it.

* FIXED: PceEmacs and editor: management around the undo buffer.  This
  should fix various problems in this area.

* FIXED: PceEmacs completion items to explicitely convert to a string
  in canonise.

* FIXED: Class socket: convert port to network byte-order in the address
  specification.  Also fixed in xpce-client.  Only affects big-endian 
  (e.g. Intel) machines.

* ADDED: `image->mask' to support non-rectangular images.

* ADDED: Read and write of XPM colour images when compiled and linked
  to -lXpm (auto-detected by configure).

* ADDED: `display <-image', to get an image from a rectangular portion
  of the display.

* PERFORMANCE: Much better performance for various graphics operations
  on images.

* FIXED: Redraw management for `opaque' graphical objects.  Moving
  Such objects sometimes caused parts of the window not to update
  correctly.

* ADDED: Resource-based rebinding of all the XPCE keyboard-editable
  classes: editor, text_item, list_browser, etc.

* MODIFIED: Non-editable text_item will not show its line.

* ADDED: ListBrowsers shift-click to extend and control-click to toggle
  the selection.

* FIXED: Win32 cut/copy of text to translate between internal and external
  text format.

* CHANGED: Menu's of kind ->cycle to show as a combo-box.

* FIXED: Undo for editor/textbuffer.  The bug was associated with resizing
  an undo-cell, which almost exclusively happens in case-conversion
  commands.

* CHANGED: {Dialog,DialogGroup,Button} <->default_button are now implemented
  on the basis of the attribute `button<->default_button', rather than the
  accelerator.

* FIXED: details regarding geometry management of browsers to ensure
  a browser of height 2 can actually display 2 lines.

* ADDED: ScrollBar <->auto_hide: automatically hides a scrollbar if it
  is no longer needed as all data is visible and redisplay it again if
  too much data arrives.

* ADDED: ComboBox implementation, based on the completion mechanism of
  class text_item.  See text_item->style.

* FIXED: and improved: numerous issues concerning completion-browsers
  for text-items to make them feel much more natural.

* FIXED: Behaviour of scrollbars if the object scrolled is not too much
  bigger than the window (provide more `natuaral' scrolling).

* ARCH: Slightly modified the relation between XPCE and the window
  environment for handling dialog objects (controllers).  In the old
  version, all dialog work was done entirely by XPCE, based upon the
  virtual-window-system graphical layer.  In the current version, part
  of the dialog handling is directly handed to the `virtual-dialog'
  layer.  This layer implements the item for the look-and-feel it
  belongs to using both the virtual-window-system and direct access
  to the underlying system.

  At the moment, this layer is restricted to graphical operations. 
  For example, vd_draw_button_face() is supposed to draw the face of
  a button according to the current look-and-feel, giving its state
  and bounding box.  

  This approach allows for a simpler and more garanteed compatibility
  in look-and-feel.  This is currently being implemented realising more
  of the Windows 95 look-and-feel for Win32.

* FIXED: Win32: Made standard window brushes (available as @win_*_brush) work
  as images, as their name suggests.

* ADDED: Win32: Access to standard Win32 images.  All these are named
  @win_* image.

* MODIF: PceEmacs Prolog/Source File entry to only show `user' source
  files.

* FIXED: Win32: Colour compatibility of non-bubble part of the scrollbars

* FIXED: Win32: Bottom-right pixel of elevated areas was not painted.

* Win32: Improved alignment and layout of triangles in the arrows of
  scrollbars.

* GUI: PceEmacs: when entering a directory if a file is requested, the
  system will open the standard viewer.

* GUI: TextItem completer improvements:	Deleting text when the completer
  is show back to the point where it was started now removes the completer.
  If no `prefix' is specified, cursor up/down will properly highlight the
  selection now.

* FIXED: X11: avoid sending characters twice to the window holding the
  keyboard focus in a frame if the pointer is on the border of the frame.

* FIXED: Win32: Force immediate window update after drop of files.

* ADDED: Win32: Class win_metafile: full encapsulation of Windows metafiles,
  both Win32 enhanced metafiles and Windows 3.x metafiles: load
  and display them, save them in any format, put them on the clipboard
  and get them from the clipboard.  This provides easy exchange of
  drawings with the popular Microsoft Tools.  These features have been
  exploited in PceDraw.  If someone has a library for Unix ...

* FIXED: Win32: creating PostScript from images, frames and display.

* FIXED: Creating HBITMAP handles for images of <-kind: bitmap.

* FIXED: return-type warning for PceEmacs find_definition command.

* FIXED: `var->unlink' to remove the variable from the binding-block.
  Thanks the Lourens van der Meij for providing me with a program that
  demonstrated the problem deterministically.

* FIXED: `device ->layout_dialog' to use ->do_set instead of ->set for
  resizing sizeable objects.  Makes list-browsers and editors behave
  normally in this context.

* FIXED: The scrollbar of an editor sometimes appears at the left-side,
  despite the preference is set to right.

* ADDED: ->label and similar methods to class editor.


[VERSION 4.8.19]

* ADDED: maintenance of correct source-location for Prolog clauses
  implementing methods. REQUIRES SWI-Prolog 2.7.12 or later!

* FIXED: ->orientation type check to accept 'south_west'.  Thanks to
  Donalt Kwakkel. 

* FIXED: pce_extend_class to accept variable, resource and class-directives.


[VERSION 4.8.18]

* FIXED: XPCE/SWI-Prolog detect now on basis of the *basename* of the
  file rather then the entire path

* FIXED: Win32: loading .ico file images.  Broken when moved to 32-bit
  platform.

* FIXED: new(C, colour(@default, R, G, B)).

* FIXED: Error reporting if loading pl2xpce.so fails, removed pushing
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH in pce_pl.pl as this didn't work anyway (ld.so checks
  these variables only at startup).  Removed require/1 definition from
  XPCE/SWI-Prolog interface, as this predicate is part of Prolog since
  a while.

* DISTR: Removed various outdated files. 

* FIXED: (hopefully) mispositioned Popup menus on some X11 servers and/or
  window managers.

* FIXED: Module handing in the Prolog <-> XPCE interface when an exception
  caused the global variable DefaultModule to be overwritten.  This resulted
  in messages of the type

     [WARNING: Undefined predicate: pce_realise:use_method/2]

[VERSION 4.8.17]

* FIXED: Win32 class frame: did not send ->displayed to member windows
  on ->show on/off.  Did not invoke ->mapped too.

* FIXED: Win32 problem in brush caching.

* FIXED: menu-redraw problem when a menu-item in a non-popup menu
  has not-nil <-popup.  Win32 only.

* FIXED: redraw problem in horizontal scrollbar when not displayed at
  x=0 (i.e. when used as a graphical).

* FIXED: `text->margin' handling (displays box for unknown character
  after the string on Win32, possible alignment problem on X11).

* FIXED: Notably popup-driven action sometimes refused to redraw
  properly.

* ADDED: library(pce_toc): table-of-contents browser library.

* ADDED: SWI-Prolog help library.  Modified plrc to make a more neat
  connection between XPCE and Prolog.

* MOFIFIED: `tile->enforced' now has additional argument, used by
  `frame->fit'. See documentation.

* ADDED: Window ->left, etc. may be given a tile to insert windows
  at arbitrary positions.  Also modified `tile->left' and friends to
  realise this.  Used by the new SWI-Prolog help GUI.

* FIXED: If a tile message arrives on a window that has a decorator,
  delegate it to the decorator.

* FIXED: PceEmacs: M-x manual_entry: better feedback and handling of
  man -s on Solaris.

* FIXED: PceEmacs: capitalisation of popup-labels followed by ...
  (find_file, etc.).

* MODIFIED: Menu-bar event-handling:
	+ After clicking, moving to another popup will open this
	  popup.

* FIXED: avoid failing `key_binding->typed' for prefix and other built-in
  commands.

* ADDED: loc-still management for Win32 version.  Windows-95 compliant
  implementation of class menu-bar.

* ADDED: `alignment' attribute to `menu_bar->append' to allow for flush-right
  of (for example) the help-button.  Implemented `menu-bar ->geometry' and
  `menu-bar <-hor_stretch' to support this functionality.

* FIXED: 'device->append_dialog_item' to ensure the item has auto_align
  set to @on.

* FIXED: `display->inspect_handler' handling.  Also speedup of the
  implementation.

* FIXED: Win32 version: PostScript generation for text objects.

* MODIFIED: Resource parsing is not longer done using the X11 resource
  manager, but using XPCE's own resource reader.  It now loads the file
  $PCEHOME/Pce, which loads $HOME/.Xpce

* ADDED: Class tab for `tabbed dialog windows support' as commonly found
  in Windows '95 application.  Also class tab_stack for creating a stack
  of tabbed dialogs.

* ADDED: event-type loc-still to detect the pointer hasn't moved for a while.
  This can be used to display feedback messages, etc.

* ADDED: Class dialog_group, for defining a boxed group of dialog
  objects with a label.

* MODIFIED: General cleanup of arithmetic, improving on its range, precision
  and error handling:
  
	* Tagged integers with range +/- 512 M (not changed)
	* Object integers (class number) with full 32-bit range
	* Floats (class real) using double-precision representation
	* Expression and equation now handle floating point numbers.
	* All arithmetic is caried out in 32-bit integer arithmetic
	  as long as the arguments premit such and converted to double
	  precision floats otherwise.

* FIXED: PceEmacs starting of the server if the socket is still present
  from a previously crashed session (which happens mostly to myself after
  I overwrite the running executable :-().

* FIXED: Process termination handling for Solaris (PceEmacs kill-buffer
  crashed if the buffer was connected to a live process).

* FIXED: Path problems in pl/src/Makefile.bin

* FIXED: `arc->points' arithmetic.  Also fixed a bug in the virtual window
  system interface code for arcs in the Win32 implementation.

* FIXED: `@display ->draw_in' (didn't do anything).

* ADDED: `frame->event', `frame->cursor' and `frame->grab_pointer'.  `Frame
  ->event' handles resizing the subwindows now.

* MODIFIED: behaviour details on `tile->set' if `tile <-enforced' is @on,
  to support resizing subwindows better.  Added `tile <-sub_tile_for_resize'
  to support computation of subwindow resizing in frames.

* MODIFIFIED: Various details to the colour resources, r_3d_box() and some
  details to class menu to achieve prettier looking menus and buttons, using
  a slightly darker colour when depressed.

* ADDED: optional `size' argument to `device ->layout_dialog'
  and `dialog->layout' to force the dialog-layout algorithm to distribute
  the items properly over dialog windows that are too big for their
  contents.

[VERSION 4.8.16]

* ADDED: configuration for ldconfig

* FIXED: Reload-from-id in the Dialog Editor to restore the can_resize
  property.

* ADDED: support for displaying images to the left of lines in a browser.
  The image is specified using the icon option of the associated style.

* ADDED: `image <-scale' to scale bitmaps.

* ADDED: `list_browser ->{next_line,previous_line}' and some keybindings
  to support proper keyboard driven handling of list_browsers.

* ADDED: Event-conversion for many more `named function keys': page_up,
  page_down, end, insert, help, etc.

* FIXED: Exit immediately if loading pl2xpce.so fails, instead of reporting
  lots and lots of error messages caused by this.

* PORT: Solaris to use sysinfo() rather then gethostname() for better
  System-V compatibility.

* ADDED: @pce <->trap_errors.  When set to @off, all runtime errors will
  be ->report'ed and the tracer will never be trapped.  Useful for running
  apps.  @pce->trap_errors sets @pce->trace to `never'.  @pce->trace has
  a new value, called `error', which confirms to the old `never'.

* FIXED: Added some extra conditions to connect_gesture to make it behave
  better when not used entirely as it was designed for.  It is no longer
  obligatory to invoke the super method of ->verify in subclasses of
  connect_gesture.  Updated the class documentation.

* MODIFIED: Changed default extension for PostScript output to be .eps,
  which appears to be more conforming to the current standards.  PceDraw
  now add a showpage command to the file, so files can printed directly.

* DEBUG: Improved error reporting when sending a message to a freed
  or otherwise invalid object-reference.

* ADDED: optional `ignore_case' argument to `char_array->suffix' and
  `string->ensure_suffix'.  Should be added to some more of the text
  analysis methods.

* FIXED: Update after sending a message from the Prolog window to XPCE
  for the Win32 version (broken with the new pl-2.5.x interface).

* FIXED: Added case-insensitive file handling in the standard library finder
  for the Win32 platform.

* FIXED: Loading images from file on the Win32 platform.  Guaranteed display
  of picture windows that have been loaded from file.

* FIXED: Dialog Editors handling of menu_items with messages in associated
  popup menus.  Modified code-generation, make_dialog/2 and reload-from-id.

* FIXED: `stream <->record_separator' handling.  Probably broken since
  version 4.8.14.  Also improved underline/bold handling and feedback
  for M-x manual_entry in PceEmacs.

* Added `graphical <-displayed_cursor' to make cursor computation available
  to the (advanced) user.

* Integrated SICStus interface and moved SWI-Prolog interface to the new
  2.5.0 interface.  Both Prolog's now share the same interface.

* PceEmacs: Added conversion of - to _ for entering M-x commands.

* PceEmacs: Fixed M-P in completer field when no history was present.

* INTERFACE: Created hooks for malloc()/free()/realloc() to allow for
  host-defined versions of these.

[VERSION 4.8.15]

* PceEmacs: changed fundamental, language and text mode to use the supported
  begin_emacs_mode/end_emacs_mode rather than the low-level equivalents. This
  ensures the display is not opened when PceEmacs is compiled, enabling the
  SICStus-3 save_program to be able to save XPCE with both the manual tools
  as well as PceEmacs compiled.

* INTERFACE: Deleted HostAction(HOST_WRITE/HOST_FLUSH, ...).  Added Cflush()
  to the interface callback structure.  Also added malloc, realloc and
  free to this structure to allow for embedding in environments where
  the standard functions may not be used.

* MODIFIED: renamed exception redecared_reference to redeclared_reference.
  Same with the error.

* ADDED: class->delete_send_method and class->delete_get_method to ensure
  proper handling of the exception-based method binding.

* INTERFACE: 1-st argument of pceNew() (assoc) is now a PceName instead of
  a plain char *.  Same for cToPceString() and pceExistsAssoc();

* PERFORMANCE: Speedup of handling message objects having exactly one argument.

* INTERNAL: Modified class-definition structure for built-in classes.  Also
  built-in methods are now bound `lazy', reducing startup-time and memory
  usage.  

* FIXED: `graphical <-keyboard_focus'.

* FIXED: various problems in the dialog editor: horizontal alignment detection,
  code generation for objects with explicit position and some minor problems
  in the look of the dialog editor itself.

* FIXED: library(dragdrop) memory management for handling <->source.  Lead
  to `invalid integer reference' if <-get_source yields an unconnected
  object.

* MODIFIED: `Dialog ->apply' and `Dialog ->restore' now deactivate the
  <-default_button when completed.

* FIXED/MODIFIED: Dialog Items now correctly report the Y of their reference
  point to the baseline of the label, dominant text or similar attribute.
  Notably fixes layout of left-to-right aligned dialog items, but may lead
  to displacement in applications that corrected to misalignment.

* FIXED: Editor <-clone.  Didn't properly clone the reference from the
  text-buffer.  Introduced `variable ->clone_style: reference_chain' to
  realise this.  Necessary to make editors work properly in the dialog
  editor.  Also fixed Editor ->save_in_file.  Similar problem.

* FIXED: Load/save to directory objects using ->save_in_file.

* ADDED: Changed chain_list/2 to behave much more as a logical predicate.

* MODIFIED: Deleted @pce <->print_c_stack and the gC option to the tracer
  to do so.  This didn't work on most machines anymore and shouldn't harm
  users.

* FIXED: Default button layout on 2-D openlook mode.

* FIXED: browser->typed to delegate to its <-list_browser.

* FIXED: area->set: misspelled argument name height.

* ADDED: Manual search tool.  See Browsers/search.

* FIXED: `frame ->wait' now waits till the frame is not only mapped, but
  also all windows in it have been painted properly.

* FIXED: Redraw problem on colour screens in menu-bar, notably appearing
  on Solaris!! 

* FIXED: Readline interface library, avoiding crash on illegal instruction
  after ^Z and repeated repaint of the first line on resize.  See
  ftp://swi.psy.uva.nl/pub/SWI-Prolog/readline

* FIXED: `path->geometry' for paths containing no points.

* FIXED: `path<-segment' to avoid division by zero when there is a zero-
  length segment in the path.

* BUILD: Removed obsolete xversion.h stuff from Makefiles and x11 directory.

* ADDED: User-defined graphics.  Allow for the redefinition of _redraw_area
  and added ->clip, ->unclip, ->save_graphics_state, ->restore_graphics_state,
  ->graphics_state, ->draw_line, ->draw_poly, ->draw_arc, ->draw_box,
  ->draw_fill, ->draw_text and ->draw_image.

* FIXED: Removed maximum number of points for a polygon.

* FIXED: Editor: honour text-colour of selection_style resource.

* WIN32: Fixed look of browsers having a label.  Added ->pen to list_browser
  and editor.  Changed resources to exploit these.

* WIN32: Added inferior process interface.  Consider this ALPHA code, but
  provided you have a 32-bits NT console application `grep', PceEmacs
  allows you to do M-x grep in both Windows'95 and NT.  Doesn't work in
  win32s though.  Use `@pce->has_feature: process' to test for the
  availability of inferior processes.

* ADDED: `file->is_absolute' to provide platform-independent checking for
  absolute filenames.  Used by `emacs_shell_mode<-directory', but probably
  should be inserted in more places.

* WIN32: Fixed scrollbar repeat-timer stuff (actually, worked around timer
  bug in Windows '95).

* WIN32: Fixed loading of ~/.Xdefault for personalised initialisation.

* ADDED: `chain<-next' and `chain<-previous' to query the order in a chain.

* FIXED: path<-segment if there are 0-length segments (division by zero).

* ADDED: `text_item ->value_width' to specify fieldwidth in pixels. Modified
  initial value of `text_item: auto_value_align' to @off.

* FIXED: pullright-mark in popup to be 3-d style again.

* ADDED: PceDraw: select-all option to the edit menu.  Added ->fill_dialog
  to the main draw class to improve embedding capabilities.  Modified
  hide/expose to restack the graphical only 1 level.  Added key-bindings for
  actions on selection: DEL --> delete_selection, Control-H: hide, Control-E:
  expose, Control-C: copy.

* FIXED: Event-handling for nearly-vertical or -horizontal lines.

* FIXED: Button-indicating messages in dialog editor.

* FIXED: stayup-mode handling of multiple-nested popup menus.

[VERSION 4.8.14]

* MODIFIED: handle `list_browser <->open_message' if multiple selection
  is @on and <-open_message is not @nil.

* FIXED: use new mclock() for timing of graphical->synchronise.  Makes this
  functionality compatible in WIN32 and centralises portability of timing.

* FIXED: PNM `RAWBITS' format.  It appears scanlines are byte-aligned.

* ADDED: Bound ESC to cancel search in listbrowsers.  Also to cancel completer
  of text_item.

* MODIFIED: moved quoted-insert from editor to key_binding, so other
  text-objects can exploit this as well.

* FIXED: column preservation in editors for next_line/previous_line.  Cleanup
  of `key_binding->typed' implementation.

* ADDED: Forwarding current selected status of dict_item while executing
  the messages associated with a browser.

* ADDED: `list_browser ->change_selection' as an explicit message.  Allows
  to hook into the list_browser's selection mechanism.

* FIXED: selection visualization problem in browsers associated to the
  first item.

* FIXED: removed premature overflow for XPCE arithmetic functions, provided
  the used C-compiler supports 8-byte integers.  Configure checks for the
  support of long long.

* ADDED: new(X, file) to return a file object with a system-dependent
  temporary name.

* FIXED: Various event-handling issues for scrollbars, resulting in better
  repeated scrolling and largely reducing problems with OpenLook
  scrollbar automatic mouse-movement.

* CHANGED: Edit capabilities for the manual tools are now bound to the
  resource Pce.ManManual.edit rather then checking write-access to the
  manual/reference directory.

* FIXED: reopening a help-file after the sequence open, split, join,
  close.

* FIXED: PceEmacs: Compile Buffer from buffers not asociated to a file
  (just gives proper message), WIN32: consult_region to use proper
  tmp filename.

* FIXED: Various issues around process exit.  Updated demo(chess) and
  emacs_shell_mode to exploit the new features.

* FIXED: {list_browser,editor}->reference to use `graphical ->reference'
  rather then `device ->reference' to make these objects fit into the
  dialog layout schema.  Fixed various related problems in the
  dialog editor.  Proper interpretation of the reference point still 
  needs to be implemented in the dialog editor.

* ADDED: Completed floating-point support for class slider.  Added ->format
  to allow formatting (floating) numbers.

* FIXED: Class process to handle premature death of the child more elegantly.

* WIN32: `window->flash'.  Didn't work and left graphical infrastructure
  in an unstable state.

* FIXED: VisualHierarchy print command to be better portable.

* WIN32: Fixed `frame ->delete: Window'.  Fixes `delete-other-windows'
  in the help system.

* ADDED: More flexible argument interpretation from tracepce/1 and
  breakpce/1.

* ADDED: Allow `class <->resolve_method_message' to be a c_pointer
  with similar semantics as `method <->message'.  This makes it easier
  to hide the dynamic binding of methods from the tracer and saves a
  bit of time during startup.  Internal.

* ADDED: `point <-plus', `point <-minus' and `point <-mirror' to make
  position arithmetic a bit more natural.

* FIXED: Dialog editor temporary file handling for Win32 platform.

* FIXED: `file ->find'.  Crashed if one of the path-components contained
  variables or other constructs that cannot be expanded (again if page
  0 is unreadable, otherwise it has a very small propability to	yield
  the wrong answer).

* WIN32: Added read/write for PNM (Portable aNy Map) image format.  This
  allows for the exchange of colour images between the Unix and Win32
  versions.  `image ->save_in_file' and `file<-object' use this format,
  making saved image-objects portable between the platforms.

* FIXED: Attempt to convert an integer to a colour lead to a crash.

* ADDED: `popup ->show_current' to put a style-dependent mark of the current
  selection in the popup.  Replaces the `hack' to use `popup ->on_image'.

* ADDED: Logical-font handling system: see '@display ->font_alias' and
  friends.

* MODIFIED: `menu<->kind'.  The new look-and-feel treated `marked' and
  `choice' the same.  Both motif and windows define menus with marks
  next to the item.  Therefore, `marked' implies to use marks if the
  style allows for that, `choice' means use some modification of the
  item (elevation, a box, invert, etc).

* FIXED: Rewrote layout of PCE finder (library(find_file)) to use automatic
  layout, so it will behave properly on different look-and-feel.  Also
  fixed for case-insensitive file-systems.

* WIN32: Fixed serious bug in low-level graphics, causing the system to
  run out of graphical resources when using image-based fill-patterns.

* FIXED: `chain <-complete_name' when ignore_case := @on and their are
  several matches with different case-pattern.

* WIN32: Modified library(file_item) to be case-insensitive when
  the class-feature case_sensitive on class file indicates this.

* FIXED: 'file ->backup' to give proper error message if it can't make
  a backup.

* FIXED: `image <-postscript' for colour images on system that donot permit
  read-access to the first memory page (i.e. a null-pointer was dereferenced
  for reading, but the result wasn't used, so the data didn't matter).

* FIXED: `display ->load_font_family'.

* PW3: Checked :- require/1 directives, checked the building process for
  SunOs.

* DOC: Generated the reference manual.  Documented use_class_template/1
  in the online manual.

* FIXED: class <-send_method and class <-get_method to handle the cache
  properly.  The error was harmless for normal message passing, but could
  lead to a serious performance degradation.  It crashed the ClassBrowser
  on some methods.

* INSTALL and C++: Defined creation of versions-controlled libXPCE.so
  and only a small shared object to load this to SWI-Prolog.  This is
  cleaner and allows the usage of the same XPCE shared object with both
  the C++ and Prolog versions.  Also allows for creating XPCE/C++ shared
  objects and linking them to XPCE/SWI-Prolog.  Developed and tested on
  PC/Linux using ELF.

* MODIFIED: `@pce <-home' to initialise as default and set from $PCEHOME
  when needed.

* WIN32: Programmed around MSVC++ 2.0 optimizer bug for ker/goodies.c.

* FIXED: Input handling in class stream to avoid a crash if executing the
  ->input_message of the stream destroys the stream (fixes problems in
  socket and process).

  [sent C-part of the patches to AIIL]

* FIXED: PceEmacs server package to deal properly with invalid requests.

* ADDED: dict ->insert and dict <-sort_by to manipulate sorted dictionaries
  more efficiently.

* FIXED: Visualisation update problem in list_browser after a ->sort.

* INSTALL: Configure fixed for users of a shell that doesn't export $PWD.

* ADDED: ->drop and ->preview drop to emacs_fundamental_mode to allow for
  dropping files on PceEmacs windows.

* ADDED: `directory ->modified' to check for modifications in a directory

* FIXED: Source option on demo tool.  Now uses absolute_file_name/3.

* MODIFIED: ImageViewer demo to use directory_item for realising
  completion on the directory.

* MODIFIED: Dialog editor to exploit the new drag-and-drop gestures.  All
  actions are now moved from the middle to the left mouse-button, so the
  system gets less dependent on the middle-button.  Deleted dialog/prompter;
  the dialog editor now uses library(pce_prompter).

* FIXED: directory->scan to handle the hidden_too argument properly.

* FIXED: Prevented `editor->event' from calling ->report: status, '' through
  endIsearchEditor().

* ADDED: Indirected all internal calls of `editor->caret' as a message, so
  the application can keep track of moving the caret in an easy way.

* ADDED: Proper geometry management for text-item objects that allow for
  more interactive editing in the dialog editor and better layout of dialog
  windows.

* UPGRADED: library(pce_prompt) to be a bit smarter and more useful in simple
  applications: better feedback on errors, automatic generation of menus,
  list_browsers or text_item.  Completion in text_item if appropriate.

* ADDED: editpce/1 to accept objects: editpce(@blabla) will edit the source
  file of the class to which @blabla belongs.  Also, editpce(@blabla->hello).
  Same for manpce/1.

* MODIFIED: drag_and_drop_gesture and drag_and_drop_dict_item_gesture to
  use a normal cursor.  This will fix problems with systems not supporting
  big cursors or making a mess out of them (most colour X11 servers).

  The ->preview_drop method now has an optional position argument, allowing
  the receiver to preview the location of the drop and possibly only allow
  for dropping in restricted areas.  The dialog editor usage of the drag
  and drop gestures have been modified to handle this.

  Both gestures are now defined on the left-button by default.  These gestures
  ->cancel if the up is within 5 pixels of the down, allowing other gestures
  to cooperate with them.  See the dialog editor for details.

* FIXED: left-drag from dialog objects in dialog editor to yield an undefined
  method.

* FIXED: dialog editor: documentation on @prolog to work ok.

* FIXED: `event->inside' now works for windows and succeeds if the event is
  in the visible area of a window.

* FIXED: getting position of an event relative to a device in another window
  as from where the event was generated.

[VERSION 4.8.13]

* UPDATED: PW3 version:
	- Fix to input-handling.  New windows where sometimes only filled
	  after moving the pointer in the window.
	- Update of the Prolog dependencies and PW3 specific Makefiles.
	- Fixed incorrect definition of make/0 and source_warning/2.

* INSTALL: make dv-install to install the development system with SWI-Prolog.

* FIXED: restarting the dialog editor, moving the help-files to appl-help
  directory.

* FIXED: configure for Linux/ELF

* ADDED: checkpce/0 to check for unclosed class-definitions.

* FIXED: checkpce/0 to consider pce_prolog_class/1.

* PERFORMANCE: speedup of pce_autoload_all/0 by using pce_prolog_class/1.

* ADDED: pce_prolog_class/[1,2]

* FIXED: Protected get_methods and send_methods from the incremental
  garbage collector while executing.

* INSTALL: Reorganised the Makefile architecture.  The aim is to be able to
  build multiple configurations using the same sourcetree. To avoid
  problems with old ar(1) programs, some files have been renamed to fit
  in 14 characters.  The configure programs have veen moved to the src
  subdirectory.

* REMOVED: library(pce_common).  This file defined some SWI-Prolog specific
  predicates for SICStus.  Now moved to the SICStus sourcetree.

* ADDED: `@pce <-version', additional argument to obtain short form and
  numeric form.

* FIXED: PceDraw: set `modified' after paint of prototype, auto-alignment
  after pasting a prototype holding no text objects.  Both found and fixed
  by Lourens van der Meij <lourens@cs.vu.nl>.  Thanks.

* FIXED: `class ->save_style_variable' to <-clone the variable if it isn't
  onwed by the class (copy-on-write).  Fixes save problems in PceDraw and
  other saving displayed graphicals.

* FIXED: `Source' option from the manual tools to start PceEmacs properly
  if it is not running.

* DOC: Added default/3

* PW3: Fixed signal() interface.  This fixes execution of
  `process ->terminate_message' and `@pce ->catch_error_signals'.  The
  latter is useful for locating errors.

* PW3: Fixed graphical update when commands arrive from the terminal.

[VERSION 4.8.12]

* FIXED: Multiclick generation in confirmers (sometimes required a button
  to be clicked multiple times).

* MODIFIED: Class click_gesture now accepts <->multiclick: @default, indicating
  the gesture should respond to any type of click (single, multiple).  Allows
  for fast-clicking on a button.

* FIXED: `class ->instance_variable' to handle the cache properly.

* DOC: added pce_image_directory/1 and pointers to it.

[VERSION 4.8.11 (= ProWindows-3, version 1.3]

* FIXED: PostScript generation for class text: handle <-border correctly.

* FIXED: Windows on multiple displays when displaying text objects.

* CLASSCOMPILER: The XPCE class compiler (handling :- pce_begin_class ...
  :- pce_end_class) has been rewritten completely.  Instead of producing
  directives, the current version produces prolog code that creates the
  classes on the basis of XPCE exceptions.  The code is supposed to be
  fully compatible, with the following exceptions (COMPATIBILITY)

	* Wrappers around pce_begin_class/pce_end_class should use the
	  user:pce_pre_expansion_hook/2 hook predicate.

	* The class-definition predicates cannot be called directly
	  anymore.

	* Directives to the class under construction should be written
	  as

		:- pce_class_directive(Goal)

	  with the exception of:

	        :- send(@class, ...).
		:- use_class_template(Template).

	  which are tagged automatically (but it is not forbidden to
	  use pce_class_directive/1 explicitely.

* PROWINDOWS: Many small fixes to various parts of the code.  All the manual
  and demo tools are working perfectly now (using Quintus Prolog 3.2).

* EDITOR: Fixed ->position right after editor is created.

* FIXED: Memory management problem in class regex, related to cloning
  and destroying regex objects.  Lead to various types of errors.

* ALLOC: Removed some dead code, making it a bit faster and cheaper.
  Made checking in ALLOC_DEBUG mode more strict.

* FIXED: `object ->save_in_file'.  Bug was introduced in 4.8.10.  Also
  fixed saving windows (including their frame).

* DIALOG EDITOR: Various minor modifications leading to version 0.5.
	* Ported to Quintus for ProWindows.
	* Better readability of the behaviour model ports.
	* Correct handling of the size of editors.
	* Fixed code generation for cycle menus.
	* Added (rudimental) support to communicate between dialogs
	* Added handling of function objects in the behaviour model.

* FIXED: Utility predicates portray_object/[1,2] to handle recursive
  objects.  Also added rules for booleans, quote_function and when.

* FIXED: Handling data for sockets only works if the display is opened.
  This is now opened automatically.

* ADDED: `socket <-peer_name' to find address of socket at other end.

* FIXED: SGI/IRIX autoconf generation of the LDSOFLAGS value -shared and
  POINTER_OFFSET for all machine needing this macro.

* ADDED: `real <-compare' to allow sorting chains on the value of reals.

* FIXED: popup_gesture: handling of focus such that programs using
  window?focus_event?<something> will work again.  Fixes the dialog
  editor.

* ADDED: Bold style to M-x manual_entry in PceEmacs.

* FIXED: pce_image_directory/1 resulting in an undefined method when
  used before any graphical operations.

* FIXED: `directory ->scan' to include files starting with a dot if the
  pattern includes this.

* FIXED: Avoid previewing non-active menu items in popup menus using `stayup'
  mode. 

* FIXED: Dialog Editor code generation for cycle menus.

* FIXED: Finding the demo sources.

[VERSION 4.8.10]

* FIXED: Redraw problem when displaying windows in windows.

* FIXED: socket <-address now yields valid address (port) after the sequence
  new(S, socket(0)), send(S, listen, message(...)).  Killing the pce_server/1
  using the exit command now works properly as well.

* FIXED: editor repaint problem for word-wrapped long lines holding hidden
  fragments.

* FIXED: popup_gesture->terminate: ensure to release focus when activating
  `popup ->execute'.  Fixes event-focus problem with stayup-popup style.

* ADDED: Indirection over `link <-connection' for handling
  `graphical->connect'.  Allows for easier to modify the connection
  behaviour of class connect_gesture.

* FIXED: browser/OpenLook Scrollbar: middle click in scrollbar activated
  the browser's <-open_message.

* FIXED: library(pce_drag_and_drop_dict_item) now uses <-label to be dragged
  rather than <-key.

* MODIFIED: dict_item <-key may now be any object.  dict_item<-label may
  be any char_array object (normally either string or name).  Improves the
  flexibility of dicts and saves space on the name-table.  Notable, some
  applications may wish to use integers as keys.

* ADDED: Generation of coloured PostScript for all graphical, except for
  pixmaps. (will follow later).

* ADDED: Improved schema to handle shared resources with object save/restore.
  See `object<-storage_reference'.

* FIXED: Postscript generation for pattern-filled objects.

* ADDED: Generation of PostScript grey-maps from coloured image objects.
  Makes screen-dumps and PostScript generation of diagrams containing
  coloured images much better.

* ADDED: Image interface for PNM (PPM, PBM, PGM): Portable aNy Map format.
  Allows for reading and writing colour images.  PNM is the central format
  of a set of public domain tools for the conversion of bitmaps to numerous
  formats.  Added format argument to image->save for saving in different
  formats.

  A variant of the PNM format is now used for storage of images in saved
  objects (`object ->save_in_file'), providing display-independent saved
  images for all versions of XPCE.  This fixes bugs in save/reload of
  PceDraw pictures holding captured windows.

* FIXED: Incremental garbage-collector error.  The incremental garbage
  collector missed objects reaching 0 reference count when not running
  in debug mode.  This fix should have serious impact on memory usage.
  There may be cases where old code used to run and now yields `bad PCE
  integer reference' or `send to freed object' warnings. If you know
  what object is deleted, you can try to find the context of the
  deletion using:

  ?- get(class(<theclass>), send_method, unlink, M),
     send(M, trace, @on, full,
	  message(@pce, print_stack, 10, @on)).

  Which will cause a dump of the top-10 stackframes whenever an instance
  of <theclass> is destroyed.

* ADDED: Automatic mapping of colours to nearest available colour if the
  colour map is full.  Avoids `PCE fatal error: red: ->_xopen failed"
  messages (notably on colour displays when running together with netscape
  that unkindly allocate lots of colours).

* ADDED: `colour ->unlink' and changed definition of class colour such that
  colours are destroyed if they reach 0 reference count.  This should minimise
  the amount of colours used by XPCE.  Colour objects no longer have a global
  reference.  Thus, @white_colour, etc. no longer exist.

* FIXED: Better checking for valid colour specification in colour->initialise.

* PERFORMANCE: Various minor and major changes to improve performance:
	+ Exploit new SWI-Prolog 2.0.10 C-interface function PL_univg()
	  to speed up the interface.
	+ Prolog interface GetCompound changed to exploit name interface
	  table.
	+ cToPceReference() reimplemented
	+ Type-checker improvements
	+ Efficient structure initialisation for new objects by maintaining
	  a prototype
	+ Editor Fragment-linking algoritm improved

* ADDED: Lazy method-binding schema to speedup loading of Prolog (precompiled)
  files.  Changed pce_term_expansion/2 and adds various features to class
  class.  Should be 100% compatible, except for applications redefining 
  PCE's term_expansion.
  
* FIXED: hash-table resize problem that wasted memory (result was ok).

* ADDED: `always' argument to `graphical ->synchronise'.  If not @on,
  synchronise will be a no-op if the last executed synchronise was less
  then 200 milliseconds before.  Symplifies user-interaction in loops.

* FIXED: Bug in `text_buffer <-content'.  Could lead to various kinds
  of problems depending on the memory layout of the target system:
  false answer (too short, padded with rubish) or crashes.

* FIXED: `image ->draw_in' if the object has <-selected: @on.

* FIXED: Redraw of figures with >0 ->border and an outline/background.

* FIXED: `directory ->scan' to honour the hidden_too argument if the same
  chain is given for files and directories.

* CLASS COMPILER: Changed various things to the method resolution system to
  allow for lazy binding of methods.  See `class <->resolve_method_message'.
  This changes the class compiler and the semantics of pce_expand/2.

* FIXED: Bug in `display_manager ->dispatch'.  May have let to crashes on
  some platforms.  Once the system has an open window the problem
  (initialisation ordering) was gone.

* ADDED: `connection ->event' to consider recognisers associated with the
  line of the link.

* FIXED: 'text_item ->advance: clear'.

* FIXED: pce_autoload(class, demo(ispell)) and similar calls.


[VERSION 4.8.9]

* ADDED: PostScript generation for *all* graphical objects using intermediate
  image objects.  See `graphical ->_draw_post_script'.

* FIXED: PostScript generation for graphical objects filled with a solid
  colour object.

* ADDED: WinSock support for the win32 port.

* FIXED: elevation handling associated with `figure->elevation', followed
  by figure->background.  Now uses the new method `elevation <-modify' to
  avoid messing up read-only elevation objects.

* CHANGED: Library structure for demo and contrib modules.  Instead of
  library('demo/something') or library('contrib/something'), you should
  now use deme(something) or contrib(something).  Part of ProWindows
  integration.

* FIXED: event-processing for normal graphical objects displayed on
  instances of class tree using `tree->display'.

* FIXED: redraw problems when modifying the area of graphicals displayed
  on a figure with a defined outline or background.

* CONFIG: All references to stdin/stdout/stderr in the library have been
  wrapped into a small layer defined in itf/console.c to allow for window
  based I/O.

* FIXED: Class editor will pick the window's keyboard focus when clicked
  on.

* C-interface: added class c_pointer to pack arbitrary C void * in an XPCE
  object.  Added interface function cToPcePointer(void *ptr) to convert
  C-pointers into XPCE objects.  Currently used by the C/C++ interface.

* CONFIG: use alien types for passing text-access functions to class text_image.
  avoids the need to smash a C-function pointer into a XPCE integer.

* CONFIG: added WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN configure option to replace __i386__
  dependency.

* FIXED: `regex->for_all' for regexes that can match the empty string to avoid
  loops.

* ADDED: `text_buffer <-clone' hooks to realise proper cloning of the alien
  data associated with text_buffer objects.

* MODIFIED: library predicate pce_server/1 now exits the server when receiving
  the `exit' command.  xpce-client will terminates immediately on reaching
  end-of-file in the input.  With the -b flag it will wait for the socket
  to be closed by xpce.

* FIXED: class(window) save-style for <-current_event and <-focus_event set
  to `nil' to avoid saving event objects.

* FIXED: `fragment ->string' for subclasses of class fragment that redefine
  the ->emptied method to destroy emptied fragments.

* MODIFIED: `directory <-{file,directory}' only uses the path of the receiver
  if the name of the argument is not absolute now.

* ADDED: `fragment ->include' to determine whether or not the start/end
  is included in the range.  Determines expansion if the insertion takes
  place exactly on the border.

* FIXED: `regex <-match' while operating in a fragment object.

* MODIFIED: Added `move_end' argument to `fragment ->start'.

* MODIFIED: The fragment-list of class text-buffer now ensures that, if
  two fragments start at the same position, the larger one is first in
  the list to improve the notion of `nested' fragments (order used to
  be undefined).

[VERSION 4.8.7]

* FIXES: Integrated Quintus' modifications to 4.8.0.  Mostly portability
  issues.  `frame ->expose' now guarantees the window is mapped before it
  is exposed.

* CONFIGURE: added support for runtime version generation:
  configure --enable-runtime.

* ADDED: `style ->left_margin' and `style ->right_margin'.  Raised the maximum
  number of arguments to C-defined methods from 10 to 16 for style->initialise.

* FIXED: `editor ->selected_fragment_style' when defining the colour of the
  characters.

* FIXED: class -><undefined method> lead to a delegation loop.  Bug introduced
  with class_stub (4.8.5)

* MODIFIED: Class tree is now a subclass of class figure instead of class
  device.  Allows for use of ->background, ->border and ->pen.  As figure
  is a subclass of device, this should not have compatibility consequences.

* ADDED: `tree ->root' may be used to clear the entire tree as well as to
  assign a new root to the tree.

* ADDED: PceEmacs: `Prolog/Source File' to jump to any loaded sourcefile.

* ADDED: PceEmacs: outline mode.  Specification is experimental.
  Suggestions are welcome.  Currently implemented for Prolog and C
  modes.

* ADDED: `style <->hidden' to implement `hidden' text fragments: text that
  remains in the buffer, but is invisible to the user.

* UPGRADE: Class regex has been upgraded to use version 0.12 of the GNU
  regex library from emacs 19.28.  This appears to fix a number of bugs
  in searching and matching.  Unfortunately the new regexes are not 100%
  compatible to the old:

  INCOMPATIBILITIES:

	# prefix\(repeat\)+postfix
	Used to return as register 1 the entire span from the first to
	the last matched `repeat'.  Now only returns the last.  Please
	use prefix\(\(repeat\)+\)postfix to get the desired behaviour.

  FIXES:

	# `regex <-registers' now really works.
	# \(repeat\)* now appears to match very long texts

[VERSION 4.8.5]

* FIXED: PceEmacs: script-mode now makes menu.  Otherwise mode refinement
  doesn't work properly.

* FIXED: PceDraw middle-click on text objects `pasted' always.  Now only
  if the text object has the caret.

* FIXED: <-displayed handling of windows when displayed on other windows.

* EXTENDED/FIXED: 16-bit character support:

	* Fixed `editor ->insert_self' for 16-bit values
	* Fixed character classification for 16-bit characters
	* Fixed methods using newline, tab and space constants
	* `key_binding ->typed' calls <-function, so this may be
	  redefined.

* ADDED: Introduced class class_stub above class class.  Intended for
  lazy creation of classes in a foreseen modification of the class
  compiler.  This modification itself will ensure better and faster
  runtime generation, but is delayed due to more urgent matters.

* ADDED: Defined load/save format to load/save plain char_array objects
  using ->save_in_file and `file <-object'.

* DIALOG EDITOR:
	- Improved guessing of horizontal layout intentions
	- Fixed destruction of various parts
	- Added optional port system for `expansions' in the behaviour

* FIXED: `editor ->dabrev_expand': first hit didn't expand if the same word
  occurred as first hit before the word to expand.  Also, button-down
  events now reset the `editor <-focus_function', canceling isearch,
  dabrev and other `local' modes.

* ADDED: `Stayup' popup handling style: clicking on an object with a popup
  or menu-bar will open the popup and allow you to click on one of the items.

* FIX: ClassHierarchy tool destruction.  Lead to a message to a freed object
  if, while the tool is running, subclasses are created below class class
  (tricky programming, but used by PceEmacs).

* ADDED: `image <-convert' now converts graphical objects.

* ADDED: `method <-summary' is now a real method.  It the slot is filled with
  @default, this method will try to look up the summary from a variable or
  refined method.

* FIX: Activate pce_group/1 declarations in variable section.

* FIX: Error handling if the display cannot be opened.  Now avoids generating
  errors in a loop and prints an elaborate user-friendly error message.

* FIX: PostScript generation for shadowed and rounded boxes.  Shadow was not
  generated in the versions 4.8.[1-4].  Generating PostScript for boxes with
  a too large radius gave `interresting' results.

* FIX: `text_buffer <-scan' with `word' unit and a syntax table that defines
  end-of-line as end-comment and the scanned word ends at the end of the file.

* FIX: Colour handling (X11 binding) that could cause colours to appear
  wrong when image related operations occurred while redrawing.

* ONLINE MANUAL: Many changes.  Look at it and donot forget to read the new
  help page.  Many manual cards have been updated.  Various cross links and
  examples have been added.  hot-links to predicates and examples are now
  provided.

* PERFORMANCE: Lazy creation of `dict <-table'.  Many dicts never use this
  table.  The table is now automatically created if the dict contains more
  than 50 items and <-member is called.  The method <-table also creates
  the table, so applications should not be affected by this change, even
  is they address the table directly.

* FIX: `graphical ->copy' did not copy the colour attribute.  Used when
  instantiating links to connections.

* ADDED `event <-click_time' and `event <-click_displacement' to simplify
  detection of `neat' clicks.

* INCOMPATIBILITY: Text objects (instances of class text) now have ZERO
  WIDTH if they contain no text.  Non-zero width was used in old versions
  to ensure the caret was inside the redraw-area.  All versions 4.8.x adopt
  a different changes schema that takes care of the caret without extending
  the area.  The current approach generally improves alignment and allows for
  texts to be displayed immediately adjecent.

  Most applications should improve.  Application that took care of this or
  relied on the few extra pixels should be fixed.  Note the existence of
  `text ->border'.

  This modification should also fix PostScript scaling problems with short
  text objects.

* ADDED: `popup->drag' and `popup->show_pullright_menu', implementing parts
  of the `popup->event' method.  The aim is to make this method easier to
  understand and allow for redefinitions to realise different look-and-feel.
  Same for `menu_bar <-popup_from_event' and `menu_bar ->show_popup'.

* ADDED: `event->is_drag' to quickly test for any kind of drag event.

* FIXED: immediate abort when there are failing make-runs in one of the
  subdirs (maintenance/development only).

[VERSION 4.8.4]

* ADDED: warnings for some common class-compiler misusages.

* ADDED: pce_error/2 in pce_pl.pl (SWI-Prolog binding) to exploit the
  generic source-location an warning system of SWI-Prolog.

* SYNCHRONISED: MS-Windows 3.1 and Unix versions.

* FIXED: `editor ->kill' for `adjecent' kills that exceed more than 10K
  characters (crashed).
  
* Various minor memory management problems (found with strict checking version
  of the alloc.c module).  Most of them just `unelegant', a few could cause
  trouble in rare circumstances.

* FIXED: Class menu_bar and class scroll_bar look-and-feel for non-open-look
  styles.

* MODIFIED: `Button <->font' renamed to `Button <->label_font'.  Ensures
  more consistent handling of resources.  `Button ->font' is added to handle
  compatibility.

* ADDED: `@pce->has_feature' to test for certain features supported in this
  version.

* ADDED: `@pce->iconify_console' to iconify the console window, provided
  this is possible.

* FIXED: `window ->unlink' deletes the window from ChangedWindows.  Fixes
  crashes in the Windows version, but the Unix version may also suffer from
  this problem.

* Included Quintus PW3 patches (Quintus compatibility).  XPCE 4.8.4 requires
  SWI-Prolog 1.9.5 or later.

* Improved changes management in class menu_bar (faster screen update).

* Fix in cycle detection in class node.


[VERSION 4.8.3]

* Renamed some *[cC]++* files and directories to *cxx* or *CXX*.

* Updated for SWI-Prolog 1.9.4, which no longer allows for local redefinitions
  os system predicates.  Also updated pce_require.pl (to generate the require
  directives) to watch for system-predicate redefinitions.

* FIX: Window (re)size problem that could result in bad window layouts,
  notably for fixed-size windows (happens very rarely).

* FIX: PceDraw: Proto/Delete (was never activated).

* FIX: area calculation of class arc.  Fixes redraw problems on arcs where
  start_angle + size_angle < 0.


[VERSION 4.8.2]

* INSTALLATION: XPCE is now configured using GNU's autoconf toolkit, simplifying
  installation.  Requires SWI-Prolog 1.9.2 or later (also configured using
  autoconf) for automatic linking to SWI-Prolog.

* ADDED: PceEmacs: `@emacs->check_saved_at_exit', called at `@pce->die'.
  Allows you to stay in XPCE if you leave any unsaved buffers.

* ADDED: PceEmacs: `emacs_buffer->check_modified_file' to check whether
  the file was modified.  Used to be part of ->modified only.  Now the
  check is also called from ->open, avoiding you viewing an out-of-date
  file.

* FIX: `@display ->dispatch' if the display is not yet opened.

* CHANGED: PceDraw now exploits class templates for a much more compact
  definition of its shape classes.  Public schema for extending PceDraw
  has been added (prototype).

* CHANGE: new/2 and friends now give a warning if the 1-st argument is
  not of the form @<atom>, @<var> or <var>.  Traps accidental reuse of
  already instantiated Prolog variables.  Actually also reveiled an
  error in font-management of the online manual reader!

* ADDED: `joint <-default_arrow' as an explicit method which should return
  the default arrow to be used for `joint ->arrows' and friends.

* ADDED: Function object @class, pointing to the currently compiling class.

* FIX: PceDraw: Background `Select Mode' menu.

* FIX: Class text positioning of centered text.

* ADDED: PceEmacs argument-prompting history added.  Using
  M-p and M-n, you can now go through the history of the current
  command.  Special purpose prompt routines have been removed to make
  the history accessible for all commands.

  A formal PceEmacs extension protocol is added.  See Help/Customise
  in the PceEmacs menu-bar.

* FIX: `meta-class' refinement through subclassing class `class' works
  again.

* FIX: `chain->move_after: member' failed if chain holds member as it's
  head.  Should succeed (and now does so).

* HOOK: Split `key_binding ->typed' into various pieces, so it is easier
  to specialise on this.  Used for M-x command history in PceEmacs.

[VERSION 4.8.1]

* ADDED: auto_call/1 to simulate an autoload call on standard Prolog
  systems.

* CHANGED: PceDraw and PceEmacs now uses @helper to display help.

* CHANGED: Many changes to the online-help library: automatic generation
  of table of contents and concept index, menus, automatic recognition
  of @colour_display, etc.  File format and programmatic access is
  compatible.

* FIXED: `Ispell' demo now works with both Ispell version 3 and 4 (change
  in communication syntax from ispell).  Also, ispell is now more careful
  in using fragments, so text_buffers using fragments may be `ispelled'.

* FIXED: `menu ->_redraw_area' deferences an invalid pointer.  Crashed
  on Irix machines.  Also fix to instantiation of X11-counterpart for
  images.  Thanks to Jan van der Steen (jansteen@cwi.nl), who also created
  new up-to-date Irix machine description files. 

* CHANGED: Hyper-text help library.  Many new features added.  This library
  is now used for an XPCE FAQ (through the manual File/Faq menu), PceEmacs,
  PceDraw and various other demo's.

* ADDED: optional `ignore_case' argument to `char_array <-compare'.

* ADDED to show_key_bindings/1 window: popup menu for switching to the
  documentation as well as the source for some method.

* Implemented: `@pce ->console_label: label'.  This method was already present
  in the MS-Windows version.  The Unix version will issue the proper escape
  sequence of an xterm(1) window if $TERM equals xterm (\033]2;label\007).


[VERSION 4.8.0]

* Changed location of the X11 resource-file Pce.  XPCE now adds PCE's
  home directory to the environment $XAPPLRESDIR, so XPCE will always
  load `@pce <-home'/Pce for finding resources.  This simplifies the
  installation and allows for different versions of XPCE to have
  different resource databases without conflicts.

* Improved OpenWindows emulation on scrollbars: 3-D version for colour
  displays, better event-handling.

* CHANGED: Focussing keyboard input has changed considerably.  The aim is
  to gain compatibility with `non-XPCE' graphical applications, to give more
  control to the application programmer and to allow for showing which object
  will receive keyboard input visually.  Methods affected:

  	`frame ->input_focus'	(changed semantics)
	`frame ->input_window'	(new method)
	`frame ->keyboard_focus'(new method)
	`window ->input_focus'	(new method)
	`window ->has_pointer'	(new variable)
	`window <-grab_pointer'	(deleted variable)
	`frame -has_returned'	(deleted variable)
	`text ->show_caret'	(now @off, passive, @on)
	`text ->event'		(new method for handling caret activation)
	
  The event-types activate_keyboard_focus and deactivate_keyboard_focus have
  been added (below type focus; see event-hierarchy demo program).

  It is unlikely that existing source-code is affected by these changes.
  Applications that want to redirect keyboard input should now consider
  using `frame ->keyboard_focus' instead of posting the keyboard event to
  the window that is supposed to receive the input.  This will send the
  necessary focus-changing events.

* Added interface predicate pce_group/1.  This predicate defines the functional
  group to which subsequent methods will be attached.  See predicate browser.
  Currently tested on class draw_canvas (part of PceDraw).  Slowly this will
  be used in more and more classes to enable quick and more useful overview
  of Prolog defined classes.

* FIX: `window ->normalise' normalised point(0,0) when given an empty chain
  of graphicals.  Now it does nothing if the union of the graphicals to
  normalise on contains no points.

* Colour handling handling feedback on selected graphicals by other means
  then using selection.  Changes:

  	* Added window <->selection_feedback (feedback on this window)
	  Allows for invert, show inverted blobs, use colour or use
	  an elevated area.
	* Added graphical ->paint_selected to paint the selection attributes
	* Added Pce.Graphical.selection_handles to define how to paint the
	  inverted blobs if this mode is choosen.
	* Deleted `class -selection_style' and Pce.Graphical.selection_style

  These changes should in most cases allow for the usage of the built-in
  graphical selection mechanism instead of reprogramming it as is commonly
  done currently.

* Dialog Editor: fixed code generation for layout.

* CHANGED: `object ->attribute' now accepts both

	send(Object, attribute, attribute(Name, Value))		and
	send(Object, attribute, Name, Value)

  which is a more pleasent syntax and avoids the creation of an attribute
  object when an attribute value has to be changed.

  INCOMPATIBILITY: send(Object, attribute, Name) in earlier releases
  was equivalent to send(Object, attribute, attribute(Name, @nil)) and
  is now interpreted as send(Object, attribute, Name, @default).

* Added class @=, an executable object to assign names to objects.  This allows
  writing myfont @= font(myfamily, mystyle, mysize, my-x-ref) and similar
  constructions in the Xdefault file.

* PceEmacs: Added `emacs_language_mode ->visit_tag_file' to allow switching
  tag-files.  Added completion for finding tag entries.  Fixed the
  switch_to_buffer pullright menu to include the plain buffer-names
  instead of the capitalised ones.  Bound \es (ESC-s) to ->sticky_window,
  toggling the sticky status of the current window.  Improved finding
  current directory in shell-mode (compilation) windows, now also considering
  output from GNU-make 3.71.

* Fixed library class file_item to properly handle somedir//newpath, etc.

* Reimplementation of `text_image ->_redraw_area'.  The `double buffering'
  of this class has been removed as it turns out that most X-servers are
  very could at painting text and not extremely good at copying large
  rectangles.  This reduces memory usage both in XPCE as on the X-server
  drastically.

* Added '#<hexdigits>' conversion for class colour.  Allows for X11
  compatible RGB colour specification.

* Added: make `graphical ->_redraw_area' an explicit method.  For the time
  being this just allows for traceing this method for debugging redraw
  problems.

* Fixed: <-summary of `boot-classes' (classes created in a special way to
  avoid the chicked-and-egg problem) has no summary description.  Fixed.

* Fixed: class(object), now correctly translates to the object reference.
  (special case as object has no <-supers).

* Fixed: `frame <-image' and `frame <-postscript' for frames that are displayed
  partly off the screen.

* Class Hierarchy Browser (Manual Tools): added resources to let the user
  distinguish between user-defined and built-in classes.

* Introduced class `elevation', to describe an elevated area: height,
  colour and colour of the edges.   Also added `colour <-hilite' and
  `colour <-reduce'.

* Introduced class `pixmap'.  Basically an image of <-kind: pixmap.  The
  explicit class facilates type specification and conversion.

* Moved `dialog_item ->apply' and `dialog_item ->restore' to class graphical.

* Added: `text <->border', providing additional space around a text object.

* Replaced `text <->transparent' by `text <->background', allowing for
  arbitrary background.  `text <->transparent' is mapped on this new
  method for compatibility reasons.

* Added: `bitmap <->transparent' to define bitmaps with non-rectangular
  shape.  Added this as a second optional initialisation argument.

* Modified resource-syntax.  Resources now use a syntax very similar to
  the Prolog syntax for objects.  For example:

  	Pce.Dialog.gap:		size(10,10)

  Old-style resource specifications are still handled, but raise the
  error `old_resource_format'.  You can use this error (by default just
  prints a warning) to locate incompatibilities or invoke:

  	?- send(error(old_resource_format), kind, ignored).

  to stop the system complaining.  The resources Pce.Display.font_families
  and the font-family implementing resources do *not* convert the old
  format.  As these will not very often be redefined by the user, this
  should be an acceptable burden.

  The reason for this is to allow for specification of resource-values
  for ambiguously typed resources.  For example, type colour|image makes
  translating a name ambiguous (either a colour-name or an image-file
  name).  In the new system, you may use `colour(red)' and `image("pce.bm")'.

  See `resource <-convert_string' for details on the new syntax.

* Resource handling and representation:

  + Class resource changes:

	# deleted: `resource <-obtained'
	A resource is not obtained if its <-value equals @not_obtained
	(a constant)

	# added: `resource <-convert_string'
	Converts the string-value read from the `resource <-default' or
	the X11 resource system in to a value satisfying the <-type.

	# Added: @resource_parser
	This global object parses resource specifications.

  + Modified resource inheritance.  Resource definitions with classes need no
  longer to be redefined at each sub-class to be able for the user to
  modify the resource.  The system takes care of refinement of resources
  when necessary, while sharing as much as possible of the data-structures.
  Lookup of resources has been speeded up drastically.

  + Flag to speed-up `object ->obtain_resources' on multiple calls to this
  method.

* Improved colour-handling:
	- Allow (window) background to be both an pixmap or a colour.
	- Allow graphical colour to be both pixmap or a colour.
	

* Added `timer ->delay' to allow suspension of the XPCE process in a
  host-independant fashion.

* Redraw now maintains multiple update-areas.  This change has provides
  an incredible speed-up for some applications.	 The infra-structure
  has been set-up for further advanced redraw planning in the future.

* Library naming.  The libraries pce_drag_and_drop.pl and
  pce_drag_and_drop_dict_item.pl have been renamed in dragdrop.pl
  and dragdict.pl to satisfy DOS naming conventions.

* Frame OPEN/CLOSE/ICONISE issues.  The port to MS-Windows made it
  desirable to clean-up the various interacting methods dealing with
  opening, iconising, mapping, etc. of frames.  All is now handled
  by the central method <->status.  `Frame <->show' and <->iconic
  are mapped onto this new method for compatibility reasons.  
  `Frame ->mapped', invoked from the X11 interface has gone.  The
  most likely usage of this method is to wait for a frame to be
  open.  This functionality is now realised by the new method
  `frame ->wait'.

* Implemented MS-Windows-3.1 version of the `Virtual Window System
  Interface'.  See source directory msw.  Additional methods for the
  MS-Windows implementation: `@pce ->console_label' and `@pce
  ->expose_console' to manipulate the console window.

* Complete reorganisation of C-source directory structure and Makefiles.
  Aim: simplify installation, reduce Unix dependency and limit filename-
  length requirements.

* Definition of class stream as a superclass for socket and process to
  share the details of asynchronic communication.  Will probably be
  integrated further.

* Virtual Window System Interface now includes the classes display and
  cursor.  For class display, this implies that some old `hacks' are
  no longer possible.  To determine the display is open, use
  `display <-opened' instead of `display <-slot: display_xref'.  The
  depth of the display is requested using `display <-depth'.  The old
  hack `display <-slot: depth' no longer works as this slot has disappeared.

  Vanished slots on class display are: display_xref, shell_xref, root_bitmap,
  pixmap_context, bitmap_context, depth, white_pixel, black_pixel,
  foreground_pixel, background_pixel and colour_map.  All this data is
  not private to the X11 inplementation of the Virtual Window System
  Interface.

* Modified: `text_buffer <->character' now fails if the index is out of the
  range of the text-buffer

* 8/16 bit version of text-representation classes

* Added: `string ->insert_character'


[VERSION 4.7.2]

* Added: overview of delegation to ClassBrowser.

* Added: library('man/behaviour_item') for entering XPCE behaviour references
  using completion.  Used by PceEmacs for M-x manpce and M-x editpce and
  by the manual card-browser for a `goto' field.

* Modified: `@emacs->server_start: Force:[bool]': Added `force' argument.
  When not @on, the server will only be started if no server exists.

* Fixed: ensured call to `window<-resize_message'

* Fixed: removed errornous error-message from `node->son' to make this
  method succeed without side-effects if the son-relation is already true.

* Compatibility: Fixed initialisation of `style <-colour' when loading old
  files.

* Fixed: trees using multiple-inheritence (e.g. directed graphs with a single
  source) did not handle `collapsed' nodes correctly.

* PceEmacs: fixed using selection as default value when prompting for files.

* More QP integration stuff: renamed emacs.pl and demo.pl into pce_emacs.pl
  and pce_demo.pl.  Some more initialization directives.

* Added: menu <->vertical_format to control the vertical alignment of items
  in their box.

* Fixed: unalloc() regex `fastmap' on ->unlink.  Fixes memory leak on
  optimised (regex ->compile: @on) regular expression objects.

* Added: `menu ->members' to set the <-members of a menu with one message.

* Added: `editor ->styles' to associate a new style-sheet with an editor.

* PceEmacs: make server windows `sticky', redefine \C-x# to mean `quit'
  for non-server windows and kill-buffer-and-return-server for server
  windows.

[VERSION 4.7.1 (PW-3 1.1 == 4.7.1 including a few patches from 4.7.2)]

* Modified Makefile to avoid the macro C++, which is refused by many
  versions of make.

* Added Makefile-i486-linux and friends for linking to Linux 1.0 (tested
  using the Slackware 1.2.0 distribution).

* (re)integration of SICStus interface: added prolog/boot/pce_expand.pl.
  this file is supposed to be loaded *first*.  the module pce_host is
  supposed to define property/1 describing some aspects of the Prolog
  system.
  
  XPCE/SICStus still does not run due to a bug in SICStus 2.1#8.  An
  fix has been promised by SICS for 2.1#9.

* Added: PceEmacs `fundamental_mode ->goto_line'

* Fixed: list_browser search as called by the text-item completion
  function.  Caused a name-table inconsistency if completion was
  requested without initial value, there was no common prefix to the
  extensions and the user tried to search the list_browser ...

* Fixed some minor problems in the reference-manual generation software
  and some group-inconsistencies.  Minor updates to the reference manual.


[VERSION 4.7.0]

* Fixed: reporting of `unresolved' types by checkpce/0 for types which
  context class has an autoload declaration.

* Modified: Default font-set generation.  See Pce.Display.font_families
  and `display ->load_fonts'.  See also README.font

* Fixed: `event ->is_a' for 8-bit characters.

* Fixed: Serious name-table hash-performance degradation, generally
  occurring with more than about 7000 XPCE names.

* Modified: Visual-hierarchy: added `dict' between `browser' and
  `dict_item'.  This is both conceptually clearer and drastically improves
  the speed of ->destroy'ing large browsers.  Browsers are now tested to
  be really fast upto 25.000 items on a SPARC-II.  

* Modified: graphical <->fill_pattern now also accepts a colour argument:
  send(Box, fill_pattern, colour(green)) make the *interior* of the box
  green.

* Fixed: Various bugs in image objects of <-kind: pixmap, notably
  colour handling: proper handling of <-background and <-foreground,
  proper opening and association with a display, proper read and write
  of individual pixels.

* Added: `visual <-container: class|code': find enclosing visual that
  satisfies condition.

[VERSION 4.6.15]

* Fixed: `window ->typed' when nested in a decorator (pictures).  This method
  handles global menu-bar accelerators.

* Added: `object ->unlinking': test if object is currently beeing unlinked
  (freed).

* Fixed: added global declaraction for @default_syntax_table.

* Added: graphical ->_redraw_area.  Allows plain graphicals to be displayed.

* Fixed: declaration of return-type of `regex <-register_value'.

* Modified: `device ->compute' no longer clears the bad_format variable
  if there is no attached format (internal).

* Added `text ->margin: Width wrap_fixed_width' which is like `wrap',
  but the <-width of the text (as a grapical) is fixed to margin value.

* DELETED `text_item ->caret' and introduced `graphical ->keyboard_focus'.

* Integration of keyboard-input for list_browser and editor: definition
  for _wants_keyboard_focus, ->next and related methods.

* MODIFIED: (list_)browser <-selection FAILS is there is no selection
  AND the multiple_selection equals @off.  Earlier releases returned
  @nil in this case.  Code written as

	get(Browser, selection, Selection),
	(   Selection == @nil
	->  bla bla

  Will have to REWRITTEN.  Most source will be unaffected however.

* Manual Tools, History menu fixed for groups containing a class
  (no-behaviour error).

* Fixed: `file ->find' for `refinding' a file from a restored object.
  Fixes bug in reloading image objects from files (file <-object) if
  the absolute pathname has changed since the ->save_in_file.

* Added: Prolog module pce_host (Prolog implementation binding):
	- callable_predicate(+Module:Head)	True if can be called
	- modified_since_last_loaded(+File)	True if file has been modified

* Fixed: ClassHierarchy: error message when asking menu on a leaf-node.

[VERSION 4.6.14]

* Restructuring of Prolog libraries:
	- Added dialog editor tool
	- Calling of dialog editor and emacs from the manual-tool menu
	- New Prolog libraries:
	* make_dialog.pl: make_dialog/2: Realise dialog built using
	  Dialog Editor.
	* pce_image.pl: pce_image_directory/1: declare a new image directory
	* pce_helper.pl: Application help-system.
	* pce_tagged_connection.pl: Connection with a tag in the middle.

* Added: `source_location <-convert' to allow editing files using
  send(@emacs, edit, 'hello.pl').

* Fixed: class <->resource if the class was not yet ->realised

* Reorganisation to prepare ports:
	- Converted to fully prototyped ANSI C.  Fixed some minor
	  bugs in the course of doing this.
	- Defined abstract window-system interface for the classes
	  window and frame.  X11 implementation thereof.

* Improved QP compatibility together with Mike Vines (AIIL): added
  :- initialization where needed, autoload definition, various
  misplaced :- meta_predicate declarations, etc.  Requires
  SWI-Prolog 1.8.9 or later to run (improved quintus.pl library).

* Fixed: drag_and_drop gestures under mwm Window-Manager

* Solaris patches:
	- Fixed starting inferior processes in PceEmacs
	- Fixed M-x manual_entry for other sections (man -s)


[VERSION 4.6.13]

* Fixed: path->initialise_new_slot to call graphical->initialise_new_slot
  (Fixes saved-object conversion for class path).

* Changes library(pce_postscript) for Quintus compatibility.

* Fixed: `key_binding->typed' when invoking a method accepting more than
  2 arguments.

* Avoid a number of useless messages to the completer of class text_item.

* Fixed: `frame ->expose' to properly set <-show: @on.

* PceEmacs: ensure that deletion of the window works (doesn't really
  quit emacs; just ->show: @off it).  By default does not show the buffer
  menu.  Added show_buffer_menu to the file menu.  Fixed `reload'
  after trapping modified buffer.  Indicate modified buffer in title
  bar of window.  Added more `window-pools', Added pool to ->identify,
  etc.


[VERSION 4.6.12]

* PceDraw: fixed: clear modified on save.

* Moved `dialog_item <->active' to the level of class graphical.  Graphicals
  that are inactive are greyed-out and not sensitive to events (unless
  the ->event method is redefined).

* Fixed: `picture ->open' if the picture had been opened before, but was
  closed using `frame ->show: @off'.

* Changed: `dialog_item <->reference' handling.  Slot-value @default now
  computes the <-reference when requested.  Otherwise the value is
  returned.  Also improved alignment of class menu_bar.

* Fixed: drawing a bitmap of <-kind: pixmap onto a bitmap with <-kind:
  bitmap.  Maps all pixels in the source foreground to 1 and background
  to 0.  All other colours yield an undefined result.

* Added: optional `times' argument to `string->newline'.

* Changed: handling of absolute paths for class file.  The aim is to
  arrive at better portable load/save facilities.  The <-name attribute
  remains in the original specification (i.e. including ~ and or $var).
  ->absolute_path writes the <-path variable and leaves the <-name
  unchanged.  See class file for details.

  This fix should make file-related saved image objects portable to
  machines on which xpce is installed in a different place.

* Fixed: Class menu for <-on_image == @nil and <-off_image \== @nil
  (crash).

* Fixed: load/save of syntax_table objects on machine with different
  byte order representation (PC/Linux).  Declared save_style of this
  class `external'.


[VERSION 4.6.11]

* Tracer: when the tracer prompts for a value, possible pointer-grabs
  are released first.  Avoids hanging, notably when the tracer traps
  an error after a display ->inform

* The method `frame->fit' is now always called using normal message
  passing.  This allows for redefinition of this method in applications.

* Fixed: replaced ln -sf in install by rm -f ; ln -s

* Fixed: ranlib entry in makefile for systems lacking ranlib

* Fixed: `fragment->overlap' if the argument is a fragment or point
  (yielded incorrect results).

* Fixed: Syntax error on unx-directory.c for solaris.

* Fixed: C++ include files now define As... as `inline'.

* Fixed: Realising the event-type hierarchy when the tracer is on.


[VERSION 4.6.10]

* Added: `fragment ->emptied' which is called by class text_buffer if
  the fragment is emptied as a result of deleting text.

* Added: `fragment ->delete' for compatibility with class string.

* Fixed: regex->for_all: include type `fragment' (implementation could
  already handle fragments).

* Fixed: view, editor: copy obtained size resource!

* Added: `graphical <-popup', complementing `graphical ->popup'.

* Added: <-clone and ->save_in_file hooks for class editor.

* PceEmacs: M-x manpce now handles descriptions such as class->method,
  etc.

* Fixed: `text_item ->enter' now invokes ->typed: id, @on on its <-device
  in order to properly handle default buttons with nested dialogues.
  
* Fixed: delCodeReference() testing for freeing object.  This should FIX
  CRASHES IN ALLOC() recently reported.

* Added: `function ->convert_loaded_object' to allow objects to be loaded
  in debug-mode that contain functions.

* Added: `variable <-return_type' for consistency with class get_method.
  Changed: `variable <-argument_type' fails if variable has no send
  <-access.

* Changed: `list_browser ->show_label: @on' default label is no longer
  `Untitled', but <-label_name of `list_browser <-name'.

* Fixed: Crash in redrawing list_browser.  It is unclear whether the
  errornous status could only be reached on a reloaded (using `file <-object')
  list_browser or that normally created list_browsers could be affected
  by this bug too.

* Added: `object <-clone' interface for the classes text_image and
  list_browser.

* Added `vector->append: value ...', store value(s) from <-high_index + 1

* Added `dict->members', doing ->clear and ->append members of chain to
  the dict.

* Added: `directory <-directory: name': return (sub)direcectory.

* Fixed: incompatibility in loading object-databases with hypers created
  with version 4.6.7 or older.

* Added: save/load (object ->save_in_file) facilities for class list_browser
  and class text_image.

* Added: AsChain(), etc. types to C++ interface (see C++/demo/dir.C).  Fixed
  lazy creation of the host instance (for XPCE/C++ stand-alone programs).

[VERSION 4.6.9]

* Installation: replaced ln -sf by rm -f followed by ln -s for compatibility
  with BSD ln versions.

* Modified: PceEmacs: Paste while a prompter is active now pasts the
  value in the minibuffer rather than at the caret in the window.

* Added: `text ->insert' to insert text (by default at <-caret).

* Fixed: stop flagging the online manual database to `modified' after
  inspecting a user-defined class.

* Fixed: ClassBrowser search with scope : `sub'. Bug was introduced by
  the changed semantics of `class <-sub_classes' in 4.6.3.

* Fixed: IMPORTANT: improper handling of reference-counting by local
  variables.  Temporary code objects that include assign statements
  could upset reference-counting.  This caused unpredictable crashes in
  searching the online manual and after switching buffers in PceEmacs.

  This fix is extremely important for the XPCE/Lisp interface as
  !setq is translated into an assign object.

* Fixed: PceEmacs refusing to switch modes under some conditions.

* Changed: portray_object/2: types are 'portrayed' by their name.

* Fixed: reference to freed object in PceEmacs miniwindow prompter.

* Fixed: figure: redraw of outline/background on changes to the internals.

* Fixed: spypce(Class <-Selector): avoid evaluation of the implementing
  function.

* Added: PceEmacs: ->drop and ->preview_drop to include sources from the
  dialog editor.

[VERSION 4.6.8]

* Added: drag_and_drop_dict_item_gesture to the online manual list-browsers
  that allow dropping methods to the (experimental) graphical activation
  model of dialog windows.

* Added: library file pce_drag_and_drop_dict_item.pl, defining the class
  drag_and_drop_dict_item_gesture for drag-drop dict-items from a
  list_browser.

* Modified library file pce_drag_and_drop.pl for better extensibility.
  New features: <-warp to switch between putting the cursor in the
  center of the dragged object and not-moving the pointer.  Also,
  ->get_source defines a function on the graphical to determine the
  object dropped.  See library files and demo programs.

* Added: `dict_item <-position' to compute the location of a dict-item
  on the associated list_browser object.

* Fixed: error reporting for incompatible slot-value in saved objects
  (file <-object).

* Errors: fixed error id redeclared_reference (called by
  `object ->name_reference') to produce a sensible text.

* Class-compiler: give warning on non-ground type-specifiers.

* Fixed: SERIOUS BUG in class window_decorator.  Caused send(new(picture),
  open) to crash on PC/Linux pl14 (any maybe other OS/compiler combinations).

* Object save/load: added `variable <-save_style' (completeness).  Fixed
  `variable <-save_style: nil' interpretation by `object ->save_in_file'.
  This fixes a bug in storing cyclic structures containing attribute-links
  with save_style `nil'.

* Fixed: Positioning of popup-menu's on windows when the window is scrolled.

* Fixed: PceEmacs: dangling `emacs_mode <-editor' references after
  switching mode and deleting the window.

* Changed: `connection ->indicate' now passes the event object instead
  of the position as a point.  Fixes linking to specific handles when
  using `cross-device' connections.

* Added `key_binding <->condition': general condition to accept events
  as for class gesture.

* Added `event <-key' to get key-description from event as used by class
  key_binding.

* Object ->save_in_file: hyper-relations are only stored if both ends are
  stored.  Based on new (rudimentary) support for save/clone using
  `relation-semantics'.  This will be further extended in the future, but
  for the moment it allows using hyper-objects to objects that are subject
  to the save-mechanism.

* Fixed: `type <-kind: member': translation now verifies argument-type before
  calling <-member on the context.  Improves error-response on methods
  with argument-type `member:<something>'.

* Fixed: load library(pce_selection) in Inspector.  Avoids trapping
  undefined method `display ->copy' and properly exports the selected
  object to the X11-selection.

* Added Pce.TextItem.search_ignore_case resource to make completion on
  value-sets case-insensitive (default).

* Added (simple) detection for creating cyclic structures in trees.  Cyclic
  trees crash the layout algorithm.

* Fixed: line (with <-arrows) PostScript generation if the <-pen of the
  line is different from the pen of the arrow.

* Type syntax: <int>.. and ..<int> are now accepted as ranges ``from
  <int> to @pce <-max_integer'' and ``from @pce <-min_integer to <int>''.
  Added to some slots, but should be added to many more.

* Added: `function ->send_super' and `class ->install'.  Made
  `code ->execute' and `function <-execute' accessible for user-defined
  methods.  This together allows for user-defined executable (code) classes.

* Class message and ? (obtain): execution now evaluates the receiver the
  same as the arguments.  This implies that

	message(XYZ?something, '_instance_of', class)

  will evaluate the obtainer (once) before starting '_instance_of'.  This
  only effects messages if the selector is defined on class function or
  below and the receiver is a function.  As the previous definition was
  rather useless it is unlikely to effect compatibility.

* Fixed: redraw of menu-label with <->layout: vertical and <-label_format
  is right or center.

* Slider: grab focus on button-down.

[VERSION 4.6.7]

* Fixed: update menu layout on dynamically changing `menu_item <-label's.

* Fixed: `menu->execute' for menu's that have no <-members.

* Fixed: `menu ->clear' when menu is not displayed.

* Fixed: `frame ->append' if the frame is already mapped.

* VisualHierarchy tool: fixed typing integer references to the text_item.

* `device ->layout_dialog' and `dialog ->layout' now discard dialog
  items that have <-displayed: @off.

* Added: `char_array <-delete_prefix'

* Fixed drawing line of text_item 1 pixel outside the area.

[VERSION 4.6.6]

* Fixed generation of .../xpce/src/files to include pce-inline.o, itf-C.o
  and gnu-getdate.o.  This should make the LispWorks installation work again.

* checkpce/0: Added checking whether all forward declarations of types
  are actually backup-up by a class-definition or an autoload definition
  for the class.  Also, if this is not the case the system won't crash
  anymore while accessing the unresolved type.

* Fixed ClassHierarchy-tool `Expand Tree': recent class reorganisation
  defines that `class <-sub_classes' either fails or returns a chain.
  In older versions an empty chain was returned.

* Made first argument of `text_item ->initialise' optional.  Allows for
  show_key_bindings(text_item) to display the key-binding table for an
  instance of class text_item.

* Added `text ->prefix' to allow for multikey sequences in text_item and
  other non-editor based editing.  ->prefix was delegated to the <-string.
  Using the new meta-key encoding for 8-bit support this resulted in an
  error when ESC was typed to a text_item.

* Modified FontViewer demo to display all characters of a character-set.

* Added quick hack to allow for handling 8-bit input (so we can handle
  full ISO-Latin-1 character sets): Meta-key no longer generates event-codes
  <value+128>, but event-codes <value+65536>.  They key_binding table
  `insert' maps the entries 128..255 onto ->insert_self.

  COMPATIBILITY: event-handlers using numeric values to specify
  meta-<key> will no longer work.  Please replace such specifications
  by symbolic ones:

	  handler('M-c', message(...))

  handles meta-c.  In most cases class key_binding provides a better
  replacement of the out-dated handler class.  Code using key_binding
  objects is fully compatible.

* Added library-file prolog/lib/pce_font_item.pl implementing class
  font_item: a compound-dialog-item for selecting fonts.  See comments
  in the file.  Class font_item is now used by PceDraw too.

* Fixed memory-leak in handling functions: executing functions left a
  reference, protecting functions for the garbage-collector after they
  had been evaluated.

* Fixed button recompute when changing <->popup on a displayed button.

* Added PostScript generation for class text when ->margin is active.

* Added `menu->sort' to sort the list of menu-items and update the
  menu afterwards.

* Fixed rounding in `text ->length' to ensure the text can actually hold
  the requested number of `ex'es.  This also fixes short text_items.

* Fixed *serious* bug in `object <-clone'.  This bug appears on variables
  that have a `named' type that represents a class.  The clone and original
  will share the value of such slots and the reference-count will not be
  maintained correctly.

* GCC-2.5.x/SunOs-4.1.x: Fixed declarations for strtod().

* Fixed: slider->redraw (OpenLook style): was drawing 1 pixel outside the
  area.  Only a problem when moving sliders.  Also fixed sliders which
  range includes negative values and ensured proper update on changing
  various slider attributes.

* Fixed: `device ->layout_dialog': offset problem if the left-side of the
  device was not the origin of the window.

* Added `menu_item ->value: value, [label]'.  Changes value *and* label,
  just like ->initialise.  COMPATIBILITY: changing the value now also
  changes the label!

* Fixed superfluous redraw when displaying text_item objects.  Notably
  speed-up of making dialog windows.  

[VERSION 4.6.5]

* Fixed area computation of class menu.  Only caused problems for
  overlapping dialog-items.

* Fixed: `menu->kind: cycle' with `menu <-look: open_look' now switches
  the <-pen to 0.

* Fixed: `button ->default_button' to force redraw on change.

* Added: `figure ->{border,radius,shadow}' to manipulate the outline of
  the figure.

* Modified `device ->advance' (controlling the caret notably in dialog
  windows) to exploit the device hierarchy.

* Fix class list_browser default-size: the default size of a list-browser
  depended on resizing other list-browsers.

* PceEmacs: fixed trapping the `Browse' menu when trying to find a
  non-existing tag (emacs_language_mode ->find_tag).

* Added `dialog_item ->name' to update <-name and recompute the default
  label.  This method calls `dialog_item <-label_name' to compute the
  default label.

* Modified object->send_vector and object <-get_vector: attempt to convert
  vector argument (Allows for passing in functions).

* Redesign of object-initialisation:

	- Replaced `variable <-initial_value' by `variable <-alloc_value' and
	  `variable <-init_function'.
	- `object ->initialise' now initialises variables and resources
	- Added type := initial_value syntax to Prolog class parser.

  NOTE: the functionality of these things are still subject to further
  changes.  The aim of these changes is to simplify object-creation and
  to make initial and default values explicit (i.e. move them from the
  code level to the meta-level).

* Cloning: set clone_style of `behaviour <-context' to `reference' and from
  class type to `none'.  This patch is necessary for the experiental
  class-template stuff.

* Fixed `event <-inside_subwindows' (X11 error when the pointer was not
  over an XPCE window).  Fixed drap_and_drop_gesture error message.

* `@pce ->syntax': realises all classes before modifying the syntax.
  This patch is necessary for the LISP interfaces.

[VERSION 4.6.4]

* Allow list_browser <-dict to be @nil (i.e. have a browser without
  an associated dict.  `Dict ->free' may now be invoked also if the
  dict is displayed in a browser (used to crash). [sorry, this patch
  didn't make it in the Linux version yet].

* Added `Mailing List' option to the file menu of the online manuals
  for (un)subscribing to the mailing list.

* Added `chain ->nth0' and `chain ->nth1'.  Fixed description of
  (outdated) `chain ->current' method.

* Version 0.2beta release of the C++ interface:
	- Added 'pceloadc++'/[1,2] in prolog/boot/pce_pl.pl
	- Added pl/src/pl-crt0.c: incremental-linking `crt0.o'
	- Added pl/src/mangle.c: mangle C++ __CTOR_LIST__ and friends to
	  avoid multiple definition conflicts when linking C++ code with
	  global constructors.
	- Changed linker-flags for SWI-Prolog to drop -r -static (linux)
	- Changed @pce<-machine to hold the complete machine description
	- Added ..../xpce/include: C++ include files and friends
	- Tested on: SunOs-4.1.3/g++-2.5.4/make/gnu-m4

* Added `function ->_name_reference' to allow for renaming functions
  rather than the thing they point too.

* Documented `chain ->move_before' and `->move_after'.

* [INTERFACE].  Added pceReInitialise(int argc, char *argv[]).  Languages
  that create a saved state should call pceInitialise() as before when
  the state is created and pceReInitialise() after a saved-state is
  reloaded.  Needed for interfacing to plain C++.

* Fixed `@pce ->bench' for invokation-style `invoke'; did not actually
  call the code n times ...

* Fixed memory-leak when invoking a host-defined vararg method.  Also
  realised speedup of this by added special-purpose creation/destruction
  functions for the code_vector object used to pass the argument-vector.

* Added `@pce <-method_calls' (statistics).

* Changed `regex ->for_all' to accept (optional) `from' and `to' arguments
  to substitute in range.

* Fixed creating example cards in the online manual,

* Added `directory <-file'.

[VERSION 4.6.3]

* Integrated SGI/IRIX-4.0.5F port (using gcc-2.4.5) from Fred Kwakkel:
  Renamed the irix md and makefiles to conform the new naming schema,
  added pl/src/Makefile-sgi-irix-4 and fixed ioctl() problem in
  src/unx-process.c

* Added `variable <->initial_value: any|function' to initialise slots
  automatically.  This feature is currently only used by the C++ class
  definition interface.

* Added class `create' to create objects using functions (i.e. as part of
  an (compound) PCE code object).

* Fixed `device <->{position,x,y}' to ->compute the device first. 
  Undisplayed devices (also class figure) yielded wrong results.

* Fixed `window ->catch_all' to take care of frame-defined methods when
  there is a <-window_decorator, but no frame yet.

* Fixed type of `device ->resize'.

* Fixed `expression <-value'.  Errors (failing functions) were not reported
  and caused all subsequent calls to this method to fail.  For error-reporting
  on functions, the method `function ->_error' is added.  Corresponding
  changes to the internal function errorPce() and the arguments of
  `error ->display'.

* Implemented pre-alpha C++ interface.

* Made creation of built-in classes dynamic.  See `class <->realised'.  As
  a consequence the start-up time is reduced for host-languages that cannot
  create a saved state *after* initialising xpce.  Initial memory consumption
  is reduced from about 1 MB to 0.5 MB.


* Added support for full 8-bit character sets: modified all char values to
  be unsigned using gcc's -funsigned-char.  Fixed gnu-regex.c for proper
  extending the sign.  Fixed dimension computations in xwn-draw.c for
  incomplete fonts (also speedup of font stuff).


[VERSION 4.6.2]

* Switch off Prolog tracer (actually SWI-Prolog, but mostly relevant to XPCE)
  before calling Prolog's on_halt() hooks to avoid recursive tracing while
  trying to get out.

* Fixed source-location registration so that for Prolog-defined classes
  <-source now always works properly.

* Fixed PceEmacs `emacs_buffer ->revert' and added revert to the file menu.

* Moved geometry-management of the classes browser, view, editor and
  list_browser to use the ->request_geometry mechanism.  This should
  remove inconsistent handling of various geometry request methods.
  These objects (like any other object) may be addressed in pixel
  units using `graphical ->do_set'.

  COMPATIBILITY: Old code that used broken methods may now result in
  very large windows.  Width and height of these classes is now always
  represented in character units!

* Added `@display <->quick_and_dirty' to choose between speed and correct
  drawing.

* Fixed changing the busy_cursor on an existing frame.  See
  `frame ->busy_cursor'.  Detected block_events=@off argument not to
  work.  This may turn out to be practically impossible using X11.


VERSION 4.6.1

* Fixed `frame <-return' when the return value is an integer.

* Added `class ->record_instances' and `class <-instances' to keep track
  of created instances.

* Added `frame ->busy_cursor' to switch the cursor temporary for all
  subwindows of a frame and `display ->busy_cursor' to do the same for
  all PCE frames in a display.  The latter is automatically used to switch
  the cursor to a watch while clicks and popups are executed.  See
  `click_gesture ->terminate' and `popup ->execute'.

* Fixed `graphical <-postscript' for not-displayed graphical objects by
  invoking `graphical ->compute' to the graphical before generating
  PostScript.

* Moved the automatic layout-system of class dialog to the
  super-class device.  Effectively this adds `device ->append_dialog_item'
  and `device ->layout_dialog' to the system, enabling `sub-dialogues'.

* Added graphicals to the automatic layout system of dialog windows.
  See `graphical ->above', etc.

* Added `@pce <-save_version' to get the version number used to tag
  saved-objects (was already documented but not implemented).

VERSION 4.6.0

* Fixed bug in tracer that causes a segmentation fault if XPCE is in
  trace-mode and the selector of a method is a function object.  The
  latter is used by the ClassBrowser tool, so running the classbrowser
  when XPCE was is tracemode could cause a crash.

* Fixed and documented `event <-inside_sub_window' to take care of
  window_decorators properly.

* Fixed undefined method (<-create_member) in PredicateBrowser.

* Fixed `window ->event': if the window had a <-popup, this was shown
  instead of posting the right_down event to the contents first.

* Fixed `fragment <-sub'.

* Fixed `window_decorator ->request_geometry' to take care of the <-tile.

* Fixed `window ->create' to take care of the <-pen properly (causes problems
  in the unlikely case that the window geometry is not changed while the
  frame is created).

* Changed printf()'s in `file <-object' into proper PCE errors:
  failed_to_convert and bad_slot_value.   This allows for silent loading
  of old (incompatible) object structures.

* Added menu-bar to PceEmacs windows to make them usable for novice
  users.

* Fixed `window ->normalise' when argument was a chain of objects that
  *can* be converted into graphicals (like node objects).

* Changed VisualHierarchy to normalise on expanded fields.  This avoids a
  lot of scrolling.

* Fixed drawing boxes for pen = 0, radius > 0 and fill_pattern != @nil.

* Added `list_browser ->reset' to restore the cursor after a crash.

* Fixed `menu_item <-default_label' when a graphical object is supplied.
  (not-closed argument list).

* Fixed menu_bar <-member to check for the `popup<-name' instead of the
  (translated) <-label of the popup menu.  This ensures the popup can
  be requested with the same name as it was created.

* Added `bitmap ->unlink' for proper unlinking of the <-image.  Fixes
  (mostly harmless :-) dangling references from images.

* Fixed error generated by exec() in class process to cannot_start_process.

* `key_binding' now checks type of the return value of <-interactive
  argument and generates a no_argument error in case of mismatch.  Avoids
  trapping the PCE tracer when an incorrect argument is returned.

* `text_item ->complete' now verifies the event_id to be a printable
  character before calling ->insert_self on the object if completion
  is not possible.  Avoids trapping the tracer when ->complete is
  bound to an event that cannot be inserted in the text.

* Implemented fully transparent interface to the X11 selection server.
  See `display <-selection' and `display ->selection_owner' for details.
  Modified class editor to use these (see prolog/boot/pce_editor.pl).
  Also modified the Inspector and VisualHierarchy tools to publish
  the selected object using the X-selection server.
  This avoids the need to redefine selection handling in other X11
  applications for proper interaction with XPCE.

* Implemented OpenWindow compatible look-and-feel:

	- Added Pce.OpenLook to the distribution.  This file may be
	  appended to Pce or ~/.Xdefaults to use XPCE in OpenLook
	  mode.
	- Added `button <->popup_image' to indicate presence of popup
	- `dialog_item <->alignment' replaces `dialog_item <->align_in_column'
	- Added `dialog_item <->label_format' to align the labels
	- Added DialogItem.label_suffix to ensure a label suffix (:)
	- Added `dialog_item <->look' for general switches on look-and-feel
	- Added `popup <->margin' to modify the popup layout.
	- Redesign of class menu_bar to use buttons
	- Changed class scroll_bar redraw and event handling.  Added
	  scroll-unit `line', also to class window, editor and list_browser.
	  Switches on the <-look attribute.
	- Fixed pen != 0 in menus
	- `menu ->kind: marked and choice' both map on feedback: box
	  if <-look is open_look.

* Added <->shadow to class box and class ellipse.  Added `graphical
  ->initialise_new_slot' to initialise the shadow slot of the new
  classes with 0.  Incremented SAVE_VERSION.  Added shadow to PceDraw
  and the PostScript generation methods for box and ellipse.

* Added `menu ->feedback' to switch the feedback style of existing
  menus.

* Fixed `real <-convert' for conversion from textual values.  Bug
  (returning wrong value) probably only existed on SunOs 4.x.x due
  to missing prototype.

* Class timer now first executes the message before setting up the next
  interval.  This avoids the system to `hang' due to to many timer events.

* Added `pce <-answer_stack_size'.  Changed the implementation of the
  answer-stack to reduce garbage on this stack.  Avoids quadradic
  (time) behaviour on some types of loops.   Performance problem is
  completely solved.  There is still a little garbage left on this stack.  

* Added breakpce/1 and nobreakpce/1 to break on PCE methods like
  tracepce/1 and notracepce/1.

* Fixed `frame <-postscript' if the frame is partially outside the
  screen.

* Added in prolog/lib:
	- Overview		Short overview of the library
	- tmw_geometry_box.pl
	- twm_resize_button.pl
	- subframe.pl		Define frames-in-windows

* Fixed new(X, real(0)) crash as reported by Ben Rabau (ISL).  For this
  purpose I added the interface function pceToCReference() that is
  similar to pceToC(), but only works on true PCE objects and always
  returns a PCE_ASSOC or PCE_REFERENCE.  Fixed pl_new() to use this
  function.

* The geometry-changing gestures (move, resize, move_outline and
  resize_outline) now use `graphical ->do_set' to bypass the new request
  branch PCE's geometry management.

* Added: display ->draw_in to draw directly on the root window of the
  display and display ->grab_server to temporary grab the server. May
  be used by dragging gestures who'se operation is not window-bound.

* Added Pce.Window.cursor resource for specifying the default window
  cursor (top_left_arrow).

* Fixed size of help window in PceDraw.

* Fixed `vector ->shift' garbage collection interaction.  This (internal)
  method caused problems with `editor ->kill' and friends.

* Added switch_to_buffer (\C-xb) to PceEmacs fundamental mode.

* Added the `type <->kind: value_set'.  Allows a type to define a member
  of a set of object.  The set may be generated by a function object.

* Changed `key_binding <->receiver' relation to use hyper objects instead
  of slot references.  This ensures proper behaviour on deleting the
  receiver of the key_binding (keybindings are reusable and should thus
  be preserved).  The inconsistency reported before by checkpce/0 was
  harmless.

* Fixed destruction of windows.

* Fixed `Quit' in online manual, Visual Hierarchy Tool and Inspector Tool.
  All tools can now freely be created/quited, recreated, etc.

* The methods `graphical ->device' and `graphical ->displayed' are now
  called internally as true methods, thus allowing the user to redefine
  these methods.  See class graphical.  The message passing system has
  been enhanced with a `Quick And Dirty' version of the send() operation,
  that checks quickly whether a method has been redefined and bypasses
  most checks if this is not the case.  QAD-send() has 1/3 of the
  overhead of a normal send if nothing has been redefined.

* Moved virtual method `window ->modified_item' to class device.  Fixes
  displaying dialog items on generic devices.  Bug reported by Ben Rabau.

* Modified send() not to report a freed object if the selector is `free'.

* Major redesign of class window and cleanup of scrollbars.

	- Introduction of class window_decoration: a window holding
	  the scrollbars and window-level labels.  This turns these
	  into ordinary graphical object, getting rid of a lot of
	  specialised code and update bugs.  Allows redefinition
	  of many things from the host language instead of only from C.

	  *COMPATIBILITY*
	  The code is as good as possible compatible.  However:

	  `window <->radius' is gone as the drawing plane now uses
	  the X11 window border and X11 does not support windows with
	  rounded corner (at least not as I want to have them).

	  `Window <->display_position' and `Window <->display_size'
	  have gone.  These (rarely used) methods are replaced by the
	  normal geometry-management.

	  `Window <-area' now reflects the area of the window relative
	  to the super-window or frame.  The new variable `window <-
	  bounding_box' now reflects the bounding box of the displayed
	  graphical objects.

	  There are various subtle changes.  All my testing applications
	  however run without modification.  Please report compatibility
	  problems.

	- Split geometry management for class graphical into a
	  request and action branch to allow for negotiation with
	  other objects.  See `graphical ->request_geometry' for
	  details.  No compatibility issues.

	- Cleaned the scroll_bar code, removing a lot of old and
	  no-longer used stuff.  Fixed the update code to avoid
	  calls to undefined behaviour and added a more efficient
	  schema.  See `scroll_bar ->compute' and
	  `window ->bubble_scrollbar'.

	  Added resource `Pce.ScrollBar.placement: name' which allows
	  the user to place the scrollbars right,left,top,bottom of the
	  window.

	  No compatibility issues.

	- Turned class window into a true graphical class.  Now allows 
	  for `windows on windows'.

	  *COMPATIBILITY*
	  `window <-area' now reflects the area of the window relative
	  to the parent (window or frame).  `window <-bounding_box'
	  reflects what the old `window <-area' did: the bouding box
	  of the displayed graphicals in the window coordinate system.
	  
	  `Window <->display_size', `window <->display_position' and
	  `Window <-display_area' have gone.  The normal methods
	  to handle graphical geometry now work properly.  Old bugs
	  like `window ->height' and other graphical window manipulations
	  not working properly should be fixed now.


* Fixed bug in trapping existing object references.  Added library
  pce_renew which allows you to redefine the behaviour of new/2 on
  an attempt to redefine an existing reference.  Fixed related exception
  generation.  The predicate pce_renew/1 allows you to preset how 
  existing references are handled: trace, free, rename, ask.

* Fixed bug in PceDraw yielding undefined <-mode behaviour

* Remove limit (100) of number of windows in a frame

* Renamed text_item <-print_name into <-print_name_of_value.  Overriding
  `object <-print_name' with different intention leads to poor error
  reporting on text_item objects.  Applications	that redefine this method
  should be changed.

* Added resource Pce.DrawCanvas.size resource to PceDraw which allows
  the user to specify the default size of the canvas (drawing area).

* Changed type of 2nd argument of `dialog ->append' from [name] to
  [{below,right,next_row}] and updated documentation.  No functional
  changes.


VERSION 4.5.12

* Added: class regex (regular) expression now operates on fragment objects
  too.	To support this, `fragment <-sub' is added.

* Fixed memory leak in incremental garbage collector.

* Added @editor_recogniser hook in `editor ->event', exploited by the
  new button-bindings for PCE editors defined in prolog/boot/pce_editor.pl
  Both selection and caret manipulation may now be used without modifiers.

* Fixed multiple kill-commands in editors.

* Fixed extending the selection to word boundaries in editors using double
  click to be compatible to other X applications.

* When switching to a non-existing file in PceEmacs, this file is no longer
  flagged modified.  Avoids save for accidently created buffers.

* Changed error no_x_server to `fatal' to avoid a loop in reporting the
  error.  Fixes error reporting when contacting the X-server fails.

* Improved saved-object compatibility: incremented save-version number,
  changed message on incompatible versions to use the error object
  new_save_version (default ignored), added `path ->initialise_new_slot'
  to fix `path <-offset', changed text load function to insert wrap and
  margin slots.  Fixed return type of `file <-object' to return functions
  too.

* Added `normalise' argument to `frame ->open', `window ->open',
  `frame <-confirm' and `window <-confirm'.  When @on, the window
  is repositioned to fit entirely on the screen.  Used by the
  text_item completer object to ensure the browser with possible completions
  is displayed entirely on the screen.

* PceDraw: fixed resizing selections (dangling resize boxes problem).

* Added: `text_buffer ->attach' and `text_buffer ->detach'.  These methods
  are called to update the `text_buffer <-editors' chain and may be redefined
  to monitor attach/delete of editors.

* PceEmacs miniwindow now completes on TAB too.

* Actually implemented the `sticky' indication at the bottom of PceEmacs
  windows.  PceEmacs now will reuse any `non-sticky' window for displaying
  a new file.  There are two pools of buffers: `file' and `other'.
  Tell me whether you like it!
  
* Fixed `Class Hierarchy' tool for the added `device <-find': now class
  tree inherits <-find from device instead of delegating to its <-root
  node object.

* Fixed xpce/make-bin-tape and xpce/install to properly handle the
  SWI-Prolog startup and include file.

* Added `kind' `progress' and `done' to the generic reporting mechanism
  realised by `object ->report', `visual ->report' and various other
  classes.  Provides a generic and easy interface to indicate actions
  such as loading a file to the application user.  Updated the manual
  tools to use this method.

* Added Prolog library "pce_drag_and_drop.pl", which implements the
  class drag_and_drop_gesture.

* PCE now allows for having click- and `drag' (move, connect, resize)
  gestures on the same button.  New methods for this:
  `click_gesture ->cancel', `gesture ->cancel', `event <-distance',
  `click_gesture <->max_drag_distance'.  Modified: `click_gesture ->drag'.
  By default, a click_gesture cancels after the user dragged more than
  5 pixels.

* Fixed `type <-value_set' with `type <-kind: alias'.  Used by
  `text_item ->complete'.

* Fixed trapping X11 events by class window to garbage collect the
  event after it has been processed.

* Fixed `frame ->return' `frame <-confirm' couple for proper handling
  of the return value by the incremental garbage collector.

* Fixed `image ->draw_in' to properly restore the position of the 
  graphical when a position was specified.  Now uses `graphical <->set'
  rather than `graphical <->position' for moving the graphical.  Also
  fixed when the graphical is currently displayed on a device with
  a `device <-format' attached.

* Added anonymous cursor objects that can be destroyed when `cursor <-name'
  is @nil.

* Changed `class ->clone_style_variable' and related class methods
  to accept integer slot identifier too.

* Added `device <-find' for locating graphicals similar to the
  event dispatching system.

* Added `event <-inside_sub_window' for locating events on frames and
  windows in frames.    

* Changed `graphical ->toggle_select' and `device ->selection' to
  invoke `graphical ->selected' using a message, so this message may
  be redefined.
