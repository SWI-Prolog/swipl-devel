    \Large \bf Schedule A: \\
    Conditions of the Software release Agreement
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Prerequisites]
The licensee is responsible for obtaining any further licence that may
be necessary to provide the computing environment required by the said
work, such as for Unix\footnote{Unix is a trademark of AT\&T} and Prolog
or Lisp.
Rights implied by this Software Release Agreement shall never exceed the
rights implied by such further licence(s) nor shall any rights implied
by such further licence(s) exceed the rights implied by this Software
Release Agreement.
    \item[Non-disclosure]
The licensee shall take all precaution to maintain the confidentiality
of the work; these precautions shall be at least equivalent to those
employed by the receiving organisation to protect its own confidential
information. 
    \item[Non-exclusivity]
The Licensee recognises that the work is released on a non-exclusive
basis and the Licensor shall have the exclusive right to grant licences
to others or to make such other use of the work as it shall desire.
    \item[Multi-cpu]
The Licensee may use the work on multiple machines within the
organisation.
    \item[Credits]
All credits in the work, both in listings and/or documentation, whether
names of individuals or organisations, will be retained in place by the
Licensee. The Licensee will acknowledge in any published copy or in any
other use of the work the authorship of the work and the fact that the
work was developed at the Licensor.
    \item[Product warranty]
The work is released on an ``as is'' basis, and there is no warranty
expressed or  implied as to the functioning, performance or effect on
hardware or other software. The licensee recognises that the Licensor
is not obliged to provide maintenance, consultation or revision of the
work.
    \item[Future releases]
This licence does not entitle the Licensee to further releases of the
work.
    \item[Source code]
The Licensor grants permission to possess and modify the XPCE
source-code.  Modifications are owned by the Licencee but this
licence still applies to modified Work as a whole.
    \item[Runtime system]
The Licensor will grant permission to distribute encapsulated copies of
the run-time XPCE software embedded in application packages to third
parties.  For each copy, a fee of XEU 100 is required to be paid to the
Licensor.
    \item[Distribution right]
If required, the Licensor will negotiate the transfer of non-exclusive
unlimited distribution rights of the XPCE software with individual
partners or the KADS-II consortium as a whole, for a lump-sum that shall
not exceed the cost of a 2 person-year development effort (i.e.\
approximately XEU 250.000).
    \item[Visibility]
In any of the above cases, the University of Amsterdam will require
visibility of the original authorship of the XPCE and associated
software.
    \item[Legality]
All parties will not be bound by any statement other than those included
in this copy of the Contract and its accompanying Schedule and this
Contract shall be governed by the Dutch law.
    \item[Licence fee]
The licence fee for members of the KADS-II consortium is 1000 XEU.
