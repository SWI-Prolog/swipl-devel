\chapter{Introduction}

One of the aims of writing PceDraw is to provide users of PCE who have
made their first steps in using the system with an example that
explains how large applications can be realised using PCE/Prolog.
This document motivates the decisions taken to arrive at PceDraw, both
at the level of the overall design and at the level of the detailed
design and implementation.

This document is part of the documentation of PCE-4.  The complete
documentation consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{Programming in PCE/Prolog \cite{PCE:Prolog}}
This document is an introduction to programming in PCE/Prolog.  It 
provides the background material to understand the other
documentation. 
    \tick{PCE-4 Functional Overview \cite{PCE:overview}}
This document provides an overview of the functionality provided by PCE.
It may be used to find relevant PCE material to satisfy a particular
functionality in your program.
    \tick{PCE-4 User Defined Classes Manual \cite{PCE:udc}}
This document describes the definition of PCE classes from Prolog.  PceDraw
is implemented as a set of user-defined classes.  
    \tick{The online PCE Reference Manual}
The paper documents are intended to provide an overview of the
functionality and architecture of PCE.  The online manual provides
detailed descriptions of classes, methods, etc.\ which may be accessed
from various viewpoints.  \cite{PCE:Prolog} describes how to
use the online manual.
\end{itemize}

This document aims at PCE users who have understood the basics of PCE
and have some experience with Prolog.  In its final context (as an
appendix) the tutorial should provide the necessary material.  When
new constructs are introduced in this document they are often
explained.  It is adviced to read chapter~\ref{sec:design} first and
proceed with the introduction and the first section of
chapter~\ref{sec:sources}. The remaining material may be used as a set
of examples.  At the end of this document is an index, indicating
references to methods, predicates and files discussed.

Chapter~\ref{sec:design} explains the overall design of
PceDraw.  Chapter~\ref{sec:sources} contains a brief overview of the
organisation of the sources, followed by the annotated sources.

Two chapters that will be part of the tutorial have been added as
appedices to this manual.  The first deals with style conventions
for the definition of classes and the second with using global
object references (e.g. @same_center).


\chapter{Design}				\label{sec:design}

\section{Functional overview}

PceDraw is a drawing tool for creating structured diagrams:
flow-charts, diagrams capturing architecture, etc.  In this kind of
diagrams there is usually a small number of reoccurring shapes that
have to be linked to each other.  For this reason, the editor should
allow the user to create/save/load a library of prototypes.  A typical
example of such a prototype is a box with centered text.  Lines
between shapes often represent semantical relations and therefore
should remain connected to the shape if the shape is moved/resized and
should be destroyed when the shape is deleted.

This document aims at the software design and implementation of
PceDraw and therefore the requirements analysis and functional
specification is very brief.  For getting a clear view on the
functionality it is adviced to run PceDraw.  It can be started from
xpce by the command:

\begin{code}
1 ?- pcedraw.
\end{code}

PceDraw has been designed from these principles.  The initial tool
consist of three areas: the drawing area itself, a menu with available
prototypes and a general command and feedback area.  Besides creating,
moving, resizing, etc., the tool must be able to edit shape attributes
such as the thickness of the drawing pen and the font.  This functionality
is dealt with by an attribute editor which can be launched in a separate
toplevel window.

PceDraw provides two kinds of menu's.  All commands are available
through pulldown menus in the `command area' of the tool.  Frequently
used commands on a single shape are also available through a
popup-menu associated with each shape.  This approach has several
advantages.  The pulldown menus provide a place where all
functionality can be found (except selecting a prototype and
operations performed via direct-manipulation such as selecting, moving
and resizing shapes), while the popup menus allows for fast access to
the commonly used commands.

\index{keyboard accelerators}
The current version of PceDraw does not support keyboard accelerators.
Defining accelerators should be supported by PCE's dialog primitives.
This will be implemented later.


\section{Realisation in PCE}

After the functionality is specified, PCE primitives that serve as a
starting point for the realisation be selected.  It is hard to tell
how this should be done.  PCE contains a large amount of functionality
that can be combined in several ways.  Examples, the tutorial and the
online manual (manpce/[0-1]) are the starting point.  Below is a brief
list with the main choices for PceDraw.  See the various sourcefiles
in chapter~\ref{sec:sources} for details.

\begin{shortlist}
    \tick{Overall tool}
A {\em frame} is a collection of windows and provides an ideal
starting point for the overall tool.
    \tick{Drawing area}
A {\em picture} is a window indended for displaying arbitrary
graphical objects.
    \tick{Prototype menu}
Two possibilities: 1) {\em dialog} + {\em menu} + {\em menu_item} or
2) {\em picture} + {\em bitmap}. See discussion in `menu.pl'.
    \tick{Command area}
A {\em dialog} with a list of pulldown menus organised in a {\em
menu_bar} and a {\em label} for feedback messages.
    \tick{Shapes}
Appropriate PCE graphical (box, ellipse, text, line, etc.).
    \tick{Prototypes}
A {\em device} is a collection of graphicals that can be manipulated
as a single unit.  The <-klone method can be used to create instances.
    \tick{`Settings' (or attribute) editor}
A {\em dialog} window with appropriate {\em dialog_items} for the
various settings.
    \tick{(Direct) manipulation of shapes}
{\em recognisers} can be attached to the various shapes.  We can
start from the various standard {\em gestures} defined in PCE.
PceDraw can operate in various modes (select, create, edit_text,
etc.).  A mode attribute can be attached to the drawing area, where
it can easily be found from the recognisers, so they can use it as
a condition.
    \tick{Load and Save}
Both prototypes and drawings must be saved and loaded to/from Unix
files.  This can be realised using PCE's behaviour `Object ->save_in_file'
and `File <-object'.
\end{shortlist}


\subsection{Creating an application}

After we have selected the PCE building blocks from which to start, we
have to extend them so that they fulfill our exact needs and cooperate
to form the drawing tool.  There are two ways to do this.  The first
is to regard PCE as a class/object library and extend/combine objects
via `free-style' Prolog code.  In this case our entire tool is (from
the outside) a collection of Prolog predicates.  The second
possibility is to create subclasses from the basic PCE classes.  Using
the latter approach, the entire tool is a class of which an instance
is created.  What are the advantages of both approaches?  We will look
at them from an example.

Suppose we have a drawing area and displaying an object on it should
change a `modified' attribute associated with the drawing area.  The
PCE class picture is our starting point.  Class picture does not
have an instance variable `modified', so our task is to add such a
variable and provide means to display an object on it and set the
modified attribute.


\subsubsection{Using PCE as a library}

When using PCE as a library, the predefined objects and classes of PCE
are regarded as a library of functionality we can access via the
Prolog predicates new/2, send/[2-12] and get/[3-13].  There are two
ways to modify or extend the behaviour of an object from a standard
PCE class.  The first is to write Prolog predicates that perform
certain operations on the object(s).  The second is to use PCE's
object-level programming mechanisms to extend the object.  Below is
the code that results from using Prolog predicates.

\begin{code}
create_canvas(P) :-
	new(P, picture),
	send(P, attribute, attribute(modified, @off)).

display_canvas(P, Graphical, Point) :-
	send(P, display, Graphical, Point),
	send(P, modified, @on).
\end{code}

Although this technique does not create a new (PCE) class, it does
create a new `conceptual' kind of object: the canvas.  `Display' is a
method of this new kind.  Depending on whether the method is defined
in the PCE class or in Prolog, the behaviour should be invoked either
via send/[2-12] or with the Prolog predicate:

\begin{code}
1 ?- send(P, selection, @nil).
2 ?- display_canvas(P, box(30,30), @default).
\end{code}

The syntactical difference makes it clear whether the action initiates
a Prolog predicate ---and thus a part of the application--- or a
method of the PCE library.  A programmer using this conceptual kind of
object must be aware whether the method is part of PCE or part of the
extension.  Calling the raw PCE method might lead to inconsistencies:
if the user invokes

\begin{code}
1 ?- send(P, display, box(30,30)).
\end{code}

the contents of the canvas will be modified, but the modified
attribute won't change.

\header{Extending the object}

The second possibility uses programming PCE at the object level.
Methods can be assigned to objects similiar to classes.  The method
object consists of three parts: the name or selector, the type
specification and the action or message.  The type specification is a
vector with the same number of arguments as expected by the method.
Each element of the vector specifies the corresponding type.  See the
online manual, topic `types'.  While a message implementing a method
is executed, @arg1 is bound the the first argument provided, @arg2
to the second, etc.  See also `Object ->send_method'.



\begin{code}
create_canvas(P) :-
	new(P, picture),
	send(P, attribute, attribute(modified, @off)),
	send(P, send_method,
	     send_method(display, vector(graphical, '[point]'),
			 block(message(P, send_class,
				       display, @arg1, @arg2),
			       message(P, modified, @on)))).
\end{code}

Using this solution, the user of the canvas does not need to know that
the ->display method of the raw PCE object has been redefined.  The
new object has a method named ->display which not only takes care of
displaying the object, but also updates the modified attribute.  Remaining
problems are:

\begin{shortlist}
    \item PCE object are created using new/2, while application objects
          area created via a Prolog predicate.
    \item From the outside one cannot tell easily whether the object is
	  a raw PCE object or a modified one.
    \item If many instances are created, each of them will have method
          objects attached to them.
    \item Writing code like this requires the user to know PCE's
	  programming classes (block, if, and, etc.).
    \item If the implementation cannot be handled by PCE's programming
	  classes a message to @prolog is necessary.  In this case the
	  implementation will be spread over two locations.
    \item The code is attached to the object.  If ---during debugging---
	  this code needs to be changed there is little alternative then
	  destroying the object and recreating it.
    \item If the object is saved using `Object ->save_in_file' or kloned
	  using `Object <-klone', the code part is saved/kloned as well.
    \item It is difficult to read and write.
\end{shortlist}

Object level programming is not used intensively in PCE, but in
some situations it is the best solution.


\subsubsection{Extending PCE}

The alternative provided by PCE-4 is to create a new class for the
canvas.  Creating a class is done using the normal PCE interface
primitives new/2, send/[2-12] and get/[3-13], but a Prolog defined
preprocessor based on the Edinburgh Prolog primitive term_expansion/2.
This is our solution based on classes.

The pce_begin_class/3 call creates class canvas as a subclass of (the
predefined) class picture.  Next, it asserts (using asserta/1) a
clause for term_expansion/2 that will convert the class declarations.
The optional last argument is the summary documentation of the class.
The pce_end_class/0 call terminates the declaration by removing the
clause for term_expansion/2.

The variable/4 declaration is expanded to attach a new instance
variable for the class.  The arguments are the name, the type, the
access rights and the optional summary documentation.  The
\verb$:->/2$ is expanded to define a send method for the class. The
first argument is `self'.  The remaining arguments are of the form
\mbox{`PrologVar:PceType'}.  The body may start with a line
'\verb$"...."::$', which is recorded as the summary documentation of
the method.  The remainder is plain Prolog code.

The method ->initialise is called from the PCE virtual machine (VM) to
initialise the instance from the arguments provided with new/2.  It
should be there if the initialisation should do something in addition
to the initialisation of the super-class.  When defined, the ->initialise
method should perform the initialisation of the super_class:

\begin{code}
send(Self, send_super, initialise, ...)
\end{code}

In this example, the variable <->modified must be initialised to @off.

The ->display method as defined below redefines the built-in method of
class picture by setting the modified flag.

\begin{code}
:- pce_begin_class(canvas, picture, "Drawing area").

variable(modified, bool, both, "Has diagram been modified").

initialise(C) :->
	send(C, send_super, initialise),
	send(C, modified, @off).

display(C, Gr:graphical, Pos:[point]) :->
	"Display graphical and set modified"::
	send(C, send_super, display, Gr, Pos),
	send(C, modified, @on).

:- pce_end_class.
\end{code}

After this, we can use the class as if it were a predefined PCE class:

\begin{code}
	...
	new(C, canvas),
	send(C, display, box(30,30)),
	...
\end{code}

User defined classes is one of the three possibilities to build an
application in PCE.  It does not have the disadvantages of introducing
`conceptual' kinds using Prolog predicates, neither the disadvantages
of using object-level programming.  Complete applications however
normally consist of a large number of objects with sometimes only
slightly different behaviour.  Using classes for each of these
categories makes it difficult to avoid large amounts of awkward
classnames.  For this reason, using Prolog predicates or object level
programming can be a good alternative for defining a class.  It is
adviced to use these techniques only for local communication and use
class-level programming for global communication between components
of the application.


\subsubsection*{Extending vs. creating classes}

PCE/Prolog allows both for extending the behaviour of existing classes
and defining new ones.  Extending classes implies redefining them,
and should first of all be used to (temporary) overcome ommisions in
the PCE system itself.  Extending behaviour of existing classes may
easily affect consistency of large applications, so be careful.

For one case, extending PCE classes may be considered.  Suppose we
have an application that creates various subclasses of the various
predefined subclasses of class graphical (e.g. box, circle, line) and
all these classes need to have some common method that can be
implemented at the level of the PCE class graphical.  In this case
it might be desirable to implement the method there instead of at
each subclass.  If you decide to do so, it is adviced to give the
method a name that clearly indicates the application for which it was
introduced, so no conflicts with other applications or future PCE
extensions is to be feared.%
\footnote{An alternative (and in this case better) solution to this
problem would be to introduce multiple inheritance.  Multiple
inheritance however introduces various conceptual problems and in
the current implementation of PCE unresolvable technical ones.}

Creating new classes however does not affect the consistency of the
system and provides a clean way to extend PCE.


\section{Class organisation and communication}

\subsection{Overall tool communication}

The application as a whole is represented by an instance of class
`draw', which is a subclass of the PCE class frame.  Class draw serves
as an overall manager of the various parts of the drawing tool.  Class
frame forms an ideal starting point to do this:

\begin{shortlist}
    \item
Any graphical object (and almost anything in such a tool is a
graphical object or is closely related to one) can easily find
the reference to the tool as a whole using `Graphical <-frame'.
    \item
Class frame can easily find all its parts using `Frame <-member'.
\end{shortlist}

For this reason, the instance of class frame is the ideal part to
support communication.  For example, feedback can be centralised by
defining a method ->feedback on the frame.  Now, any graphical object
can give feedback by doing:

\begin{quote}
	send(Myself?frame, feedback, 'I just did this').
\end{quote}


\subsection{Drawing area and shapes}

Picture and graphical are a communication couple.  The drawing area of
PceDraw is realised by class draw_canvas which is a subclass of
picture.  The various shapes that can be drawn are subclasses of
closely related standard graphical classes (e.g. box, line).  The pair
canvas and shape adds responsiveness to user-events, maintenance of
changes, etc. to the standard interaction between picture and
graphical.


\subsection{User Events (Shapes and gestures)}

Shapes define the `Shape ->event' behaviour by forwarding the event
to a reusable `gesture' object.  A `gesture' is an object that
allows for the management of a sequence of button-events, starting
with a mouse-down and ending with the corresponding mouse-up.  PCE
defines several standard gestures.  The file gesture.pl creates
subclasses to implement the specific user-interface needed by
PceDraw. 

\chapter{The Sources}				\label{sec:sources}

The application is subdivided into a number of files, each of which is a
Prolog module file and defines a number of PCE classes that serve
a similar role in the overall application.  We use the Prolog module
system to avoid possible name-conflicts with other packages for
predicates used to support the methods. Below is an overview of the
files.

\begin{shortlist}
    \tick{draw.pl}
	Defines the toplevel predicates and the class `draw', of which
	a drawing  tool  is an instance.   Class draw is a subclass of
	the PCE class `frame'
    \tick{canvas.pl}
	Defines  class `draw_canvas'; a subclass  of class  picture.  It is
	the drawing area of the editor.
    \tick{shapes.pl}
	Defines the shapes that can  be drawn  on  the canvas.  These
	shapes are  small extensions to  standard PCE classes.
	They add handles for connections and handling user events.
    \tick{gesture.pl}
	Defines subclasses  of the  PCE gesture classes.  These gestures
	are linked to the shapes to process user events.
    \tick{menu.pl}
	Defines the menu at the right of the drawing area and
	the (prototype) icons displayed on them. 
    \tick{attribute.pl}
	Defines the attribute editor  that can be  used to modify  the
	attributes of graphical objects.
    \tick{align.pl}
	Defines the automatic alignment functionality.  This file
	is not included in the sources as it adds little to the
	understanding of xpce.
\end{shortlist}

\header{Conventions}

Each source file is given in a section named ``Source file name''.  The
actual code is preceded by small line numbers at the left margin.

\include{draw}
\include{canvas}
\include{shapes}
\include{gesture}
\include{menu}
\include{attribute}


\chapter{Conclusions}

In this document we presented a medium-sized application to illustrate
how applications can be designed and realised using PCE.  We have
tried to make the design process and design decissions explicit.  No
doubth it is possible critise the code and decissions made.  Nevertheless,
we hope the sources of PceDraw form a valuable starting point for
programming in PCE/Prolog.

The drawing tool presented in this document may be used as such.  It should
be noted however that the functionality is incomplete.  Notably editing
prototypes is limited.


\appendix

\chapter{Programming Style}

As O'Keefe argues in ``The craft of Prolog'' \cite{Keefe:90}, using a
`good' programming style is not something optional.  PCE/Prolog as
presented in this document is definitely something different then
Prolog with some additional library predicates.  PceDraw as presented
here is an example of what we currently believe to be good programming
style.


\section{Organisation of sourcefiles}

The PCE class compiler allows for the definition of multiple classes
in one file.  Quintus Prolog compatible Prolog systems allow a file
represent at most one Prolog module.  What is the best way to organise
your sources?  There seem to be two reasonable solutions.

Each file either represents a Prolog module and one PCE class, or a
bundle of Prolog predicates.  Files of the first type generally do not
export any predicates.  All communication is done by sending messages
to instances of the class defined in the file.  Files defining normal
Prolog predicates do have an export list (otherwise we can't reach
their contents).  These predicates can be imported as usual.

The second possibility is to define (small) classes that belong to
each other or the same category in the same file (and module).
Internally, these classes may communicate both using Prolog calls and
by sending messages.


\section{Organisation of a class definition}

Below is a list of the various sections that make up a class
definition.  Except for the header and footer, all the sections are
optional.  Technically (currently) no ordering between the other
sections is required.  For clarity it is adviced to use a standard
schema for all your classes.

\begin{shortlist}
    \tick{Header}
This is just the \verb$:- pce_begin_class(Class, Super).$ declaration.
    \tick{Instance variable declarations}
The variable/[3-4] declarations for additional instance variables.
    \tick{X-resource declarations}
The resource/[3-4] declarations that provide access to the X-resource
database.  All aspects that are arbitrary default choices of the UI
style should be declared via resources.  This enhances clarity of the
choices and allows the user to tailor the UI.
    \tick{Handle declarations}
The handle/4 declaration to create handles for connections.
    \tick{Initialisation method}
The initialisation method of a class normally comes first.  It is
invoked by the PCE vitual machine (VM) operation new() that creates
an instance.  Messages and predicates that only support the
initialisation method (if it is very complicated; long
initialisation methods can often be found for dialog windows) are
defined right below the method. 
    \tick{Unlink method}
The unlink method is invoked from the PCE VM operation that
destroyes an instance.  It is normally declared right after the
initialisation method.
    \tick{Other reserved methods}
PCE's internals call various other methods that may be redefined.
Examples are `Graphical ->geometry', `Graphical ->event' and
`Gesture ->initiate'.  These are normally declared before the
other methods.
    \tick{Public functionality}
With this, we refer to methods that facilate the communication with
other parts of the application.
    \tick{Local utilities}
Methods and Prolog predicates that are used from various places
within this class definition are placed at the bottom.  The reason for
this is that one is usually not interrested in these things.
    \tick{Footer}
The \verb$:- pce_end_class.$ declaration terminates the declaration of
the class.
\end{shortlist}

Section~\ref{sec:class-template} provides a template for the class
declaration.

\subsection{Class definition template}		\label{sec:class-template}

\section{Choosing names}

Apart from the Prolog predicates and variables for which any Prolog
oriented naming schema applies, various other objects have to be named
while using PCE/Prolog.  Names for PCE objects have either global
scope or local scope to the class they are associated with.  Names for
classes and global objects are global.  Names for selectors, variables
and resource are local to their class.  For all these names, the
following should apply:

\begin{shortlist}
    \item Names with global scope over the entire process should be
	  short when they denote some very basic concept of the
	  application.  Otherwise they are best prefixed with some
	  indication of the category they belong to (e.g. \verb$draw_$
	  for all global names related to PceDraw).
    \item Names with local scope (selectors, variables and resources)
	  have meaningful names.  In general they should not be
	  abbreviations.  When they denote a general operation, they
	  should be named to this operation (e.g. `quit', `relate').
	  When they denote something very specific, something that
	  can be used only under some non-frequently occuring
	  situation, they should have long names.
\end{shortlist}


\section{Predicates or methods?}

When writing in PCE/Prolog, there is usually the choice between
writing a method and invoking this using send[2-12] or get/[3-13] or
writing Prolog predicates and calling these directly.  When using
user-defined classes as the basis for structuring an application, the
following rules apply:

\begin{shortlist}
    \item Communication between classes defined in different source-files
	  is always using messages.  This way the overall structure
	  of the application is based upton one mechanism.
    \item Within one sourcefile Prolog based activation/calling may
	  be used.  This however should be limited to cases where:
	  \begin{enumerate}
	      \item Data that is not easily converted to PCE data is to
		    be passed as arguments.
	      \item Prolog backtracking should be exploited.
	      \item Communication is very time critical.
	      \item It implies a private unitily.
	  \end{enumerate}
\end{shortlist}


\section{Method arguments}

Arguments to methods are determined by there location in the argument
vector.  PCE distinguishes between obligatory and optional
arguments (i.e. arguments that may be @default).  To avoid having to
look in the manual continuously it is necessary to define some
standards for argument ordering.  The rules used inside PCE have never
been stated explicitely and compatibility considerations sometimes
leaded to non-intuitive arguments.  Below is an attempt to make them
explicit.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do not use too many obligatory arguments.  If possible try
	  to limit the number of obligatory arguments to 1 or 2.  
	  `Name' or similar arguments in general come first.  `Values'
	  (e.g. `dialog_item <->selection') come second.  If there is
	  a sensible default or the user might not want to specify the
	  value because it will be filled in later, make the argument
	  optional.  Example: initialising a line does not require
	  any arguments.  Start and end-points default to (0,0).  This
	  is useful as (notably for defining links), it is not unlikely
	  the user wishes to create a line and define the start and
	  end-point later.
    \item Define sensible defaults the optional and order
	  them in decreasing `likelyness' the user might wish to overrule
	  the default.
\end{itemize}


\section{Layout conventions}

The considerations for layout of PCE/Prolog programs do not differ
very much from those for ordinary Prolog programs.  PCE/Prolog
programs tend to use deeply nested complex terms, notably while
specifying message objects.  The normal rules for breaking long
terms apply.
