 * EHANCED: Avoid that the gui-tracer ever reverts to the normal tracer by
   adding a catch-all rule.  Especially avoids deadlocks when tracing threads
   that cannot interact with the toplevel.
   
 * FIXED: Tracer handling of redo port.

==================================

* FIXED: Handling of I_CATCH and I_CONTEXT instructions for unifying and
  locating calls in clauses.

* FIXED: Avoid sending ->file: @nil to the source-view

* FIXED: `Up' pass through foreign frames, so we can really get to the top,
  regardless of intermediate foreign frames caused by breaks, XPCE message
  passing, etc.
