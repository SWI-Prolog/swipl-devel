\section{Introduction}

The XPCE/SWI-Prolog GUI tracer provides much better insight in the
execution of a Prolog program than a conventional 4 port terminal
oriented debugger by providing multiple views on the Prolog state in a
well organised manner. The system is surely interesting for learning
Prolog, but probably useful to experienced Prolog programmers.

This document presents the model on which the tracer is built and
describes the necessary interface predicates to make it run on a
Prolog environment.

\section{The Prolog Model}

The Prolog model used is based on two sources. One is the standard
4-port debugging model, with provides insight on the control-flow of
Prolog programs, the other is the model underlying the simplyfied WAM
stack layout used by SWI-Prolog.

\subsection{The port model}

SWI-Prolog is equiped with a 5-port tracer, the 4 standard ports and
the {\em unify} port.  The unify port indicates the execution of the
\wam{enter} instruction, separating the head-unification code from the
body code.

\subsubsection{Intercepting the tracer}

Before executing the default tracer, SWI-Prolog calls the hook
user:prolog_trace_interception/4.  If this hook succeeds does not call
the default tracer.  This hook is defined as:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{prolog_trace_interception}{4}{+Port, +Frame, +PC, -Action}
Dynamic predicate, normally not defined. This predicate is called from
the SWI-Prolog debugger just before it would show a port. If this
predicate succeeds the debugger assumes the trace action has been taken
care of and continues execution as described by \arg{Action}. Otherwise
the normal Prolog debugger actions are performed.

\arg{Port} is one of \const{call}, \const{redo}, \const{exit},
\const{fail} or \const{unify}. \arg{Frame} is an integer reference to
the current local stack frame. \arg{PC} is the current value of the
program-counter, relative to the start of the current clause, or 0 if it
is invalid, for example because the current frame runs a foreign
predicate, or no clause has been selected yet (at the \const{call} port.
\arg{Action} should be unified with one of the atoms \const{continue}
(just continue execution), \const{retry} (retry the current goal) or
\const{fail} (force the current goal to fail). Leaving it a variable is
identical to \const{continue}.

Together with the predicates described in \secref{debugger}
and the other predicates of this chapter this predicate enables the
Prolog user to define a complete new debugger in Prolog. Besides this it
enables the Prolog programmer monitor the execution of a program. The
example below records all goals trapped by the tracer in the database.

\begin{code}
prolog_trace_interception(Port, Frame, _PC, continue) :-
        prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, goal, Goal), 
        prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, level, Level), 
        recordz(trace, trace(Port, Level, Goal)).
\end{code}

To trace the execution of `go' this way the following query should be
given:

\begin{code}
?- trace, go, notrace.
\end{code}
\end{description}


\subsection{The stack model}

The stack is examined for two purposes: show the calling environment
(like the \tracecmd{g} command) and showing the active choicepoints.
The latter is a very important addition to the standard tracer, as
even experienced Prolog programmers sometimes introduce unwanted
choicepoints in their program.  With the GUI tracer, just skip to the
solution, and then inspect the remaining choicepoints is a simple and
effective way to find such spots in your program.

The SWI-Prolog stack is organised using stack-frames.  Each stack
frame contains the following information:

\begin{description}
    \item [state-information]
Pointers to the top of the trail- an global-stack set when the frame
is created and used to undo back to this point.
    \item [parent frame]
Pointer to the parent frame.
    \item [choice-point frame]
Pointer to the frame where execution continues if this frame fails.
This is a simplification of the `real' WAM, where choicepoints and
stack-frames are seperate entities.  It also introduces problems with
choicepoints generated in a clause by \predref{;}/2.  This problem is
solved by creating a dummy frame.
    \item [PC]
Program counter of the virtual machine, indicating the current location
in the parent frame
    \item [Clause]
Clause currently running in this frame.  Could be determined using the
program of a child-frame.
    \item [Variables]
The first $N$ variables, where $N$ is the arity of the predicate are the
arguments passed into this goal.  The others are the local variables of
the currently running clause.  The current implementation of SWI-Prolog
does not reuse variable slots, new variables are simply assigned the
next location while the compiler analyses the clause.  See also
clause_property/2.
\end{description}


The stack is analysed using prolog_frame_attribute/3:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{prolog_frame_attribute}{3}{+Frame, +Key, -Value}
Obtain information about the local stack frame \arg{Frame}.  \arg{Frame}
is a frame reference as obtained through prolog_current_frame/1, 
prolog_trace_interception/4 or this predicate.  The key values are
described below.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{alternative}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with an integer reference to the local stack
frame in which execution is resumed if the goal associated with
\arg{Frame} fails. Fails if the frame has no alternative frame.
    \termitem{has_alternatives}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with \const{true} if \arg{Frame} still is a
candidate for backtracking. \const{false} otherwise.
    \termitem{goal}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with the goal associated with \arg{Frame}. If the
definition module of the active predicate is not \const{user} the goal
is represented as \mbox{\tt <module>:<goal>}. Do not instantiate
variables in this goal unless you {\bf know} what you are doing!
    \termitem{clause}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with a reference to the currently running clause.
Fails if the current goal is associated with a foreign (C) defined
predicate. See also nth_clause/3 and clause_property/2.
    \termitem{level}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with the recursion level of \arg{Frame}. The top
level frame is at level `0'.
    \termitem{parent}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with an integer reference to the parent local
stack frame of \arg{Frame}. Fails if \arg{Frame} is the top frame.
    \termitem{context_module}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with the name of the context module of the
environment.
    \termitem{top}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with \const{true} if \arg{Frame} is the top Prolog
goal from a recursive call back from the foreign language. \const{false}
otherwise.
    \termitem{hidden}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with \const{true} if the frame is hidden from the
user, either because a parent has the hide-childs attribute (all system
predicates), or the system has no trace-me attribute.
    \termitem{pc}{}
\arg{Value} is unified with the program-pointer saved on behalve of the
parent-goal if the parent-goal is not owned by a foreign predicate.
    \termitem{argument}{N}
\arg{Value} is unified with the \arg{N}-th slot of the frame. Argument
1 is the first argument of the goal. Arguments above the arity
refer to local variables. Fails silently if \arg{N} is out of range.
\end{description}
\end{description}


\section{Getting information on a clause}

The tracer needs the following information from a clause:

\begin{description}
    \item [Source-location]
In addition to the physical location of the clause in the source file,
the system needs to know the location of the `goals' in the clause.  For
example, in:

\begin{verbatim}
a :-
	b,
	(   c
	->  d
	;   e
	).
\end{verbatim}

it needs to be able to find the location of {\bf d} if the execution
is in {\bf d} or a subgoal thereof and walks `up' the stack.  SWI-Prolog
does so in two steps.  Using the $PC$ of the frame running {\bf d} and
the clause of the frame running a/0, it calls clause_property/3 to find
the location of the subterm {\bf d}.  In this case, this is the term:

\begin{verbatim}
[2, 2, 1, 2]
\end{verbatim}

The first `2' indicate the term is in the body, the second that it is
in the second argument of \funcref{,}{2}, the `1' indicates the first
argument of the \funcref{;}/2 and the final `2' the second argument
of \funcref{->}{2}.

Next, clause_property/3 is used to find the file and line of the clause.
read_term/3 using the option \funcref{subterm_positions}{1} is then used
to find the locations of the various parts of the clause.

The tracer maintains a cache to avoid excessive file-access.  The hook
prolog_event/1 ensures information is removed from the cache if the
clause is modified.

Dynamic code goes through the same process: first the predicate is
decompiled into an XPCE \class{text_buffer}. Next it is read using
read_term/3 as above.
