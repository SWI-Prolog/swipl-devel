%			POSTSCRIPT FIGURES			%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \postscript has three arguments:
%
% 	ARG1:	the desired width of the figure (e.g. {12cm}, {4in})
%       ARG2:   the file/labelname: 
%		if the argument is {swi} then:
%		- LaTeX will search for the file "swi.ps"
%               - LaTeX will create a label "fig:swi" which you can use to
%		  refer to the figure number
%       ARG3:   the caption text (e.g.  {The SWI LoGo})
%
% The current directory will always be searched first for the figure.
% Other directories can be defined through the command \psdirectories.
% The argument of \psdirectories is a comma-separated list of full
% path names (no variables, ~, or "." allowed!) without spaces.
%
% E.g. \psdirectories{figs,/staff/guus/lib/psfig,/staff/kads/lib/psfig}
% 
% The default setting of \psdirectories is {figs}
