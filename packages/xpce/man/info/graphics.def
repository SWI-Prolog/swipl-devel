This chapter describes non-specialised graphics.  For more
specialised graphics, see
@ref{Dialogs and Menus},
@ref{Lists, Dictionaries and Browsers},
@ref{Text Processing}.

Class graphical defines the most general graphical object.  Instances
of class graphical may be displayed in instances of class device or
class window (a subclass of device).  A device may be regarded as a
collection of graphical objects.  Devices themselves are graphical
objects too, allowing for a hierarchical organisation of diagrams.

After the classes graphical and device this chapter continues with the
primitive graphical building blocks of PCE (box, circle, text, etc.).

This section explains graphical `connections'.  A connection is a line
between two graphicals that is automatically updated if either of the
two connected graphicals is moved, resized, deleted, etc.  The primitives
for handling connections are spread over a large number of classes:

	graphical	The methods of this section
	connection	The real connection
	link		Prototype description for a connection
	handle		Connection point on a graphical
	expression	Formula to specify the location of a link

The example below illustrates how two boxes may be given handles for
input and output and related.  We assume input links at the top and
left and output links at the bottom and right.

	?- send(new(P, picture('Connection Demo')), open),
	   send(P, display, new(B1, box(50,50)), point(25,25)),
	   send(P, display, new(B2, box(100,50)), point(200, 25)),
	   send_list([B1, B2], recogniser,
		     [ new(resize_gesture),
		       new(move_gesture)
		     ]),
	   send_list([B1, B2], handle,
		     [ handle(0,   h/2, input, input_1),
		       handle(w/2, 0,   input, input_2),
		       handle(w,   h/2, output, output_1),
		       handle(w/2, h,   output, output_2)
		     ]),
	   new(L, link(output, input, line(0,0,0,0,second))),
	   send(B1, connect, B2, L).

Note that neither the handles, nor the link has any direct reference to the
involved graphical objects.  It is therefore allowed create these objects
once for an application and reuse them for all instances of similar graphicals
and connections.
