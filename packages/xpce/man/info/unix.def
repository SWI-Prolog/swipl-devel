#chapter Operating System Interaction

This chapter defines classes to interact with the Unix filesystem, Unix
process management and Unix networking features.  PCE is often
advertised for UI development and therefore including classes to
interact with the operating system on features that have nothing to do
with UI may seems strange.  There are various reasons for integrating OS
interaction into PCE:

	* PCE's load and save facilities need to operate on files and
	the most natural solution is to introduce a class file for this
	purpose.

	* Symbolic languages (and especially Prolog) have only very
	limited OS interaction in the standard.  Doing the OS interaction
	in PCE allows us to write PCE/Prolog libraries that are *portable*.

	* Asynchronous interaction with processes and networking is
	desired which should properly interact with the X11 interface.
	Using host-language primitives may conflict with this schema.

	* Proper interprocess, networking and sub-process interaction
	allow for easy incorporation of external functionality.  This
	makes PCE a suitable platform for integrating multiple applications
	using a single front-end to the end-user.

The classes file and directory allow for all the common operations on
the Unix file-system
