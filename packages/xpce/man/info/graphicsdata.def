#chapter Graphics Support Data

This chapter describes datatypes to *support* graphics.  The datatypes
of this chapter are designed to just support graphics.  PCE also defines
a large collection of generally applicable primitive datatypes.

The graphics support datatypes are organised into two groups:
communication about geometry and communication about appearance (colour,
font, cursor, etc.).
