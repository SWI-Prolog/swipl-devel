#chapter Meta Objects --- Classes, Behaviour, etc.

This chapter describes PCE's meta-layer.  Each object in PCE is an
instance of class class.  Class class is an instance of itself:

	?- get(@class_class, class, Class)
	Class = @class_class

Behaviour (methods, instance variables) are stored in classes.

#class class
#description group internal
This group mainly consists of C-function pointers to speed up some of
the OMS and other time-critical operations.  They may be converted into
C-function names using `@pce <-c_function_name'.  This facility is used
by the `source' facility of the online manual.  Note the restrictions on
`@pce <-c_function_name'
