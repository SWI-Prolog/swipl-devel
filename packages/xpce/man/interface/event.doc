\section{Handling event-callbacks}	\label{sec:event} 


When PCE is active and has open windows it must process events it
receives from the X-server.  It is desirable that the user can
interact with the host-language while PCE is active.  The PCE/Host
process can therefore be seen as a two-threat process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \tick{Read and process the host toplevel}
Most interactive symbolic languages have a {\em toplevel} that reads
requests and executes them.
    \tick{Read and process X-events}
PCE has to read events from its connection to the X-server and execute
them.
\end{enumerate}

Especially if PCE is connected to a closed%
    \footnote{With {\em closed} we refer to a programming environment
	      that comes as a completely linked Unix process with an
	      external interface that does not allow for certain
	      modifications.}
programming environment, realising this functionality is generally the
hardest problem of writing the PCE/Host interface.  Currently this
problem has been solved by:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{Patch the read function of the host-language}
In the SWI-Prolog; SICStus Prolog and Lucid CommonLisp interface we
have patched the function of the host-language that reads characters
from the user for the interactive toplevel.  For both Prolog systems
this has been realised by adding a hook to the read function of
the Prolog environment.  For SWI-Prolog the low-level read function
is defined as:

\begin{code}
int (*PL_dispatch_events)() = NULL;

char
pl_get_char()
{ if ( PL_dispatch_events != NULL )
  { for(;;)
    { char c;

      if ( (*PL_dispatch_events)() == PL_DISPATCH_INPUT )
      { if ( read(0, &c, 1) == 0 )
	  c = EOF;

	return c;
      }
    }

  }

  return getchar();
}
\end{code}

The PCE/SWI-Prolog interface assigns \var{PL_dispatch_events} with a
function that processes X-events and looks for input on
file-descriptor 0.  This function returns with PL_DISPATCH_INPUT if
there is input on file-descriptor 0 and with another value on a
timeout or after processing an X-event.  This function is defines
as:

\begin{code}
static int
pce_dispatch()
{ if ( pceDispatch(0, 0) == PCE_DISPATCH_INPUT )
    return PL_DISPATCH_INPUT;

  return PL_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT;
}
\end{code}

    \tick{Use a threat in a multi-threat environment}
If the host-language is a multi-threat system it is possible to have
one or more threats that execute the interactive toplevel and one threat
that handles the X-window events for PCE.  This approach has been takes
in the LispWorks interface.
\end{itemize}

The C-functions applicable to event-dispatching are:

\begin{description}
    \cfunction{int}{pceDispatch}{int fd, int msec}
Look for X-events and input on file-descriptor \arg{fd}.  Return
\const{PCE_DISPATCH_INPUT} if there is input on the specified
file-descriptor and \const{PCE_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT} if the timer
has expired before there is input.

If \arg{fd} equals -1 no file-descriptor is watched.  The argument
\arg{msec} is the time-out time in milliseconds.  If \arg{msec} equals
0 this call blocks until there is input.  See also
`window_manager ->dispatch'.
\end{description}

When using a seperate threat to handle X-events for PCE, the following
interface functions may be applicable.  

\begin{description}
    \cfunction{void}{pceRedraw}{void}
Update the display for any changed graphical object and flush all output
for the X-server (calling \cfunc{Xflush()}).
    \cfunction{XtAppContext}{pceXtAppContext}{XtAppContext context}
If there is already an Xt application context, return this context.  Else
if \arg{context} is not \const{NULL}, make the \arg{context} the
Xt application context for PCE.  Finally, if there is no context and
the argument is \const{NULL}, create a context and return it.

This function is only necessary if the host-environment defines an
interface for X-windows that requires the application context of
PCE.  Whenever PCE itself needs the application context (normally
when it invokes `display ->open'), it will call this function with
\arg{context} equal to \const{NULL}.

There is no entry for this function in the header file
\file{xpce/src/itf-interface.h} as this would require including the X11
include files.  The necessary declarations should be made in the interface.
