\section{Errors}		\label{sec:errors}

Errors are abnormalities that are detected during a programs
execution.  Errors may be caused by internal bugs in \product{}, bugs
in the application program and finally by the application user
making errors in operating the application (e.g. specifying
a protected file).

Errors may also be discriminated according to their `seriousness': If
a certain font cannot be found it can easily be substituted by
another.  If a method expects an integer argument but the actual
argument is a graphical object it is impossible to carry-out the
operation.  In such cases \product{} will normally trap the tracer. If the
user decides to continue execution the method will return failure to
its caller.  Finally, some problems are categorised as `fatal'.  When
such a problem is encountered \product{} does not know how execution can
be continued.

All errors (except for some that may result from \product{} bugs during
the boot phase of \product{}) are represented by an \class{error} object.
An error object has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{id}
Unique identifier name of the error.  It may be used to generate
errors; look-up error objects in the @errors database or catch
errors (see pce_catch_error/2).
    \tick{kind}
The kind describes how serious the error is considered to be.  The
possible values are: {\em ignored} if the error is (currently) not
regarded an error at all; {\em warning} if the error is to be
reported, but no further action is required; {\em error} if the
error is to be fixed.  After printing the error the system will
start the tracer, allowing a programmer to examine the problem
context.  Finally, {\em fatal} errors do not allow execution to
be continued.  The system will print context information and
request Prolog to abort back to the Prolog interactive top level.
    \tick{feedback}
Determines how the error is to be reported.  If \const{print} the
error is printed in the Prolog window.  If \const{report} the
error is reported using the report mechanism described in
\secref{report}.  The `report' mechanism is for errors that
may be caused by application users, for example file errors.
If \const{throw} and there is a Prolog goal on the stack, the
error is mapped to a Prolog exception.  See below.

In the \idx{runtime-system}, all errors use feedback `report'.
    \tick{format}
A format specification to construct a message text from the
context arguments provided by the generator of the error.
\end{itemize}

The online manual ``Errors Browser'' may be used to examine the
defined errors; change attributes of errors and get precise
description of errors.


\subsection{Handling errors in the application}

\index{errors,catching}\index{catch,errors}%
Sometimes the application wants to anticipate on certain errors.
Explicit testing of all conditions is a cumbersome solution to this
problem. Therefore \product{} allows catching of errors by the
application.

There are two mechanism available to do this.  Regardless of the
`error<-feedback' type of the error, all except fatal errors can
be silenced using pce_catch_error/2:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{pce_catch_error}{2}{+ErrorSpec, :Goal}
Run \arg{Goal} like once/1. It an error matching \arg{ErrorSpec} is
raised, this error is not reported, but stored in `@pce<-last_error'.
\arg{ErrorSpec} is the <-id of an error, a chain holding error-ids
or @default.  The latter implies none but fatat errors are reported.

The example below silently ignores errors from creating a backup
of \arg{File}.  Note that the call does fail if backup raises an
error.

\begin{code}
	...,
	pce_catch_error(backup_file, send(File, backup)),
	...
\end{code}
\end{description}

If the <-feedback of the error is \const{throw} and the error is not
silenced with pce_catch_error/2 it is mapped to a Prolog exeption of
the form

\begin{quote}
\term{error}{\term{pce}{Id, ContextArgs}, Goal}
\end{quote}

For example:

\begin{code}
?- catch(send(@pce, foobar), E, true).

E = error(pce(no_behaviour, [@pce/pce,  (->), foobar]),
          send(@pce/pce, foobar))
\end{code}


\subsection{Raising errors}

The application programmer may define new (application specific)
errors.  The error object is a normal \product{} object and may thus be
created using new/2.  An error is raised by invoking `object ->error'.
The example below illustrates this:

\begin{code}
:- new(_, error(no_user,
		'%N: Unknown user: %s',
		warning, inform)).

	...,
	(   get(UserDatabase, user, Name)
	->  ...
	;   send(UserDatabase, error, no_user, Name)
	),
	...
\end{code}

Note that the names of errors should be unique.  It is advised to
reuse existing error-id's if possible.


\subsection{Repairable errors}

\index{exception}%
On trapping certain `repairable` errors, \product{} will first raise an {\em
exception}.  Exceptions may be trapped by an {\em exception handler}
which may solve the problem.  If the exception-handler fails to solve
the problem, \product{} will raise an {\em error}.  See \secref{errors}. 

Exceptions are raised by invoking `@pce ->exception: id, arg ...'.
Exception handlers are registered in the sheet `@pce ->exception_handlers',
which maps an exception-id onto a code object that handles the exception.
The following illustrates this:

\begin{code}
1 ?- [user].
|: add_user(Name) :- write(Name), nl.
^D

2 ?- send(@pce?exception_handlers, value,
          no_user,
	  message(@prolog, add_user, @arg1)).

3 ?- send(@pce, exception, no_user, fred).
fred
\end{code}

The {\em context arguments} passed with an exception are defined by the
code raising the exception.  The currently defined exceptions are
listed below.  See also the online manual: `pce->exception' and
`pce <-exception_handlers'.

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{undefined_class}
\index{class,undefined}\index{undefined,class}%
An attempt is made to reference a non-existing class while
doing one of the following: create an object; load an object from
file using `File <-object'; create a subclass.  @arg1
is bound to the class-name.  This trap is used by pce_autoload/2,
as well as by the code that realises compiled classes.
    \tick{undefined_assoc}
\index{assoc,undefined}\index{undefined,object reference}%
An attempt is made to resolve a symbolic reference (i.e. @pce),
but the reference is unknown.  @arg1 is bound to the missing
reference name.  This trap is used by pce_global/2.
    \tick{redefined_assoc}
\index{assoc,redefined}\index{redefined,object reference}%
An attempt is made to create an object with the same symbolic
reference as an already existing object.  @arg1 is bound to the
already existing reference name.  This trap is used by
\pllib{pce_renew}.
    \tick{initialisation_failed}
\index{new,failed}\index{initialisation,failed}%
The ->initialisation method for some instance failed.  @arg1
is bound to the (partial) instance; @arg2, ... are bound to the arguments
given to the new-operation.
\end{itemize}
