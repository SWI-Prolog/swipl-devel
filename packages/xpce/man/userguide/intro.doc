\chapter{Introduction}

XPCE is an object-oriented symbolic environment for symbolic languages
or strongly typed languages. The combination provides a hybrid
environment with a small but powerful and transparent interface.
Although PCE provides many general-purpose classes, it is primarily
designed to implement user-interfaces.

XPCE is not a programming language in the traditional sence. Contructs
of the system do not have a textual representation. The interface to the
`hosting' language defines what the XPCE looks like from the programmers
point of view. As a consequence, the programmer will first of all
experience XPCE as a {\em library}.

XPCE however, does provide the semantic elements that can be found in
many object-oriented programming languages: classes, objects, methods,
instance-variables, inheritance, statements, conditions, iteration, etc.

All the above primitives are represented by first-class {\em objects}
that may be created, modified, inspected and destroyed. This allows the
programmer to extend the XPCE object-oriented system with new methods
and classes from the host-language. In addition, small procedures can be
expressed as objects and then given to XPCE for execution.

The main target language for XPCE is {\em Prolog} and this document
concentrates on XPCE/Prolog rather then XPCE/Lisp or XPCE/C++.
XPCE/Prolog comes with a graphical programming environment that allows
for quick browsing of the source-code, provided debugging tools and
allows for the graphical construction of {\em dialog boxes} (graphical
windows with {\em controllers}). XPCE's built-in editor is modelled
after the standard (GNU-)Emacs editor and can be programmed in
XPCE/Prolog.


\section{Organisation of the XPCE documentation}

This document describes the basics of XPCE and its relation to Prolog.
It provides the background material needed to understand the other
documentation:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{The XPCE Reference Manual} \cite{PCE:reference}
The reference manual is available in two formats: printed and by
means of the Prolog predicate manpce/0.  The reference manual provides
detailed descriptions of all classes, methods, etc.\ which may be accessed
from various viewpoints. See also Chapter~\ref{sec:online}.
    \tick{PceDraw: An example of using PCE-4 \cite{PCE:draw}}
This document contains the annotated sources of the drawing tool PceDraw.
It illustrates many of the (graphical) functionality of XPCE.  Useful as
a source of examples.
    \tick{{XPCE/Prolog} Course Notes} \cite{PCE:course}
Course-notes, examples and exercises for programming XPCE/Prolog.  The
course-notes have a large overlap in contents with this userguide, but
the material is more concise.  If you are familiar with object-oriented
systems, Prolog and graphical user interfaces the course-notes may be
a quick alternative to the userguide.
\end{itemize}

list.  This E-mail address can also be used to communicate with the
authors.


\section{Language interfaces}

The interface between PCE and the application (host) language is very
small. This feature makes it easy to connect PCE to a new language. PCE
fits best with dynamically typed or strongly statically typed langages
with pogrammable type-conversion.  XPCE itself is dynamically typed.
Cooperating with languages with the named properties avoid the need
for explicitely programmed type-conversion.

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{SWI-Prolog}\index{SWI-Prolog (binding)}
The combination SWI-Prolog/PCE is the development version.
    \tick{Quintus Prolog}\index{Quintus Prolog (binding)}
Distributed by AIIL (UK) under the name ProWindows-3/XPCE.  This version
is commerically supported.  Contact chris@aiil.co.uk for details.
    \tick{SICStus Prolog}\index{SICStus Prolog (binding)}
This binding has been implemented in close cooperation with SICS. Prolog
libraries delivered with PCE run both on SICStus and SWI-Prolog.
    \tick{Lucid Common Lisp 4}\index{Lucid CommonLisp (binding)}
The Lisp language binding is described in \cite{PCE:lisp}.
    \tick{Harlequin LispWorks 3.1}
\index{Harlequin LispWorks (binding)}%
\index{LispWorks (binding)}%
The Lisp language binding is described in \cite{PCE:lisp}.
    \tick{GNU-C++ (g++)}
    \index{C++ (binding)}\index{g++ (binding)}
This binding is described in \cite{PCE:cpp}.  It allows for the
definition of both stand-alone C++/XPCE applications as well as
mixed Prolog/C++/XPCE applications.%
	\footnote{Mixed Lisp/SomeThing/XPCE applications are hard to handle
		  as XPCE atoms are {\sc uppercase} when linked to Lisp.}
\end{itemize}


\section{Portability}

The XPCE virtual machine and built-in class library is written in
standard ANSI-C and is portable to any machine offering a flat
sufficiently large memory model (32 or 64 bits). XPCE's graphical
classes (including windows, etc.) interface to XPCE {\em Virtual Windows
System} (VWS). Currently there are VWS implementations for X11 and the
Microsoft Win32 API. Please contact the authors if you are interrested
in other implementations.


\subsection{Unix/X-Windows}

\index{X-windows}\index{OpenWindows}\index{Motif}
XPCE runs on most Unix/X11 platforms.  Tested platforms include SunOs,
Solaris, AIX, HPUX, IRIX, OSF/1 and Linux.  Platform configuration is
realised using GNU autoconf with an extensive test-suite.


\subsection{Win32}

The Win32 API provided the required 32-bit flat memory model, making a
port of XPCE feasible.  Currently XPCE/Prolog is only available with
the SWI-Prolog host language.  A Quintus port will be available shortly.


\section{Look-and-feel}

\index{look-and-feel}\index{Motif}\index{OpenWindows} PCE is not
implemented on top of a standard UI library such as Motif, OpenWindows,
or Win32. Instead, it is built on top of its own VWS defining
primitives to create and manipulate windows, draw primitives such as
lines, circles, text and handle user-events.

As a consequence, XPCE programs are fully compatible over the available
platforms, except that some (almost exclusively obscure) features may
have a different or no effect on some implementations. For example,
Window icons in win32 are always scaled to $32 \times 32$ pixels, where
they can have arbitrary size in X11.

The implementation of all of XPCE on top of its primitive graphicals
guarantees there are no platform-specific limitations in the
manipulation and semantics of certain controllers. XPCE defines the
look-and-feel for each of the controllers.  As a consequence, XPCE
controllers may not behave exactly the same as controllers of other
applications in the same windowing environment. 

The visual feedback (look) and to some extend the reactions to user
actions (feel) of the XPCE controllers is determined by XPCE's {\em
resource} file. The X11 version examines the resources through the
standard X11 resource manager. The Win32 version contains a parser for
the X11 resource files. XPCE is currently shipped with two resource
files, one for OpenWindows and one for Windows-'95. Support for Motif
is still rudimentary.


\section{A brief history of (X)PCE}

The ``PCE Project'' was started in 1985 by Anjo Anjewierden.  His aim
was to develop a high-level UI environment for (C-)Prolog.  The
requirements for this environment came from the ``Thermodynamics Coach''
project in which Paul Kamsteeg used PCE/Prolog to implement the UI for
a courseware system for thermodynamics.  This system included a
`scratch-pad' that allowed the student to create structured drawings
of component configurations. The application had to be able to analyse
the drawing made by the student.

PCE has been redesigned and largely re-implemented on a SUN workstation
using Quintus Prolog and later SWI-Prolog \cite{SWI-Prolog:manual} in
the Esprit project P1098 (KADS).  This project used PCE to implement a
knowledge engineering workbench called Shelley
(\cite{Anjewierden:90b}).  During this period PCE/Prolog has been used by
various research groups to implement graphical interfaces for
applications implemented in Prolog.  Most of these interfaces stressed
the use of \idx{direct-manipulation} graphical interfaces. Feedback
from these projects has made PCE generally useful and mature.

This document describes version 4.8 of PCE. Version 4 is a major
release. During the versions 4.0 to 4.5, XPCE was moved from SunView to
X-windows and since 4.7 to the Win32 platform. In addition, the virtual
machine has been made available to the application programmer, allowing
for the definition of new XPCE classes. These versions have been used
mainly for small internal case-studies to validate the new approach.
Larger-scale external usage started from version 4.6 and introduced the
vital requirement to reduce incompatible changes to the absolute
minimum.


\section{Acknowledgements}

The development of XPCE was  started by Anjo Anjewierden.  The package
was  then called PCE.  He designed  and implemented  version  1 and 2.
Version 3 is the result of a joint effort from  Anjo Anjewierden and Jan
Wielemaker.

XPCE, offering support for X-windows and user-defined classes, has been
implemented by the author. The implementation of user-defined classes
was initiated when I was guest at SERC (Software Engineering Research
Centre). Gert Florijn has contributed in the initial discussions on
user-defined classes. Frans Heeman has been the first user.

The interface to SICStus Prolog has been implemented in cooperation with
Stefan Andersson and Mats Carlsson from SICS.

The interface to Quintus Prolog was initiated by Paul-Holmes Higgins.  The
project was realised by James Little, Mike Vines and Simon Heywood
from AIIL.

Luca Passani has bothered me with many questions, but was so kind to
organise this material and make it available to other (novice) XPCE
programmers in the form of a FAQ (see section~\ref{sec:faq}).

(X)PCE is used by many people. They have often been puzzled by bugs,
incompatibilities with older versions, etc. We would like to thank them
for their patience and remarks.
