\chapter{Introduction}

\product{} is an object-oriented library for building Graphical User
Interfaces (GUI's) for symbolic or strongly typed languages. It provides
high level GUI specification primitives and dynamic modification of the
program to allow for rapid development of interfaces. It integrates a
graphical tool for the specification of interfaces, in addition to
powerful and uniform mechanisms to facilitate automatic generation of
GUI's.

\product{} is not a programming language in the traditional sense. Language
constructs and objects of the system do not have a direct textual
representation. The interface to the `hosting' language defines what
\product{} looks like from the programmers point of view. As a consequence,
the programmer will first of all experience \product{} as a {\em library}.

\product{} however, does provide all semantic elements that can be found in
many object-oriented programming languages: classes, objects, methods,
instance-variables, inheritance, statements, conditions, iteration, etc.

All the above primitives are represented by first-class {\em objects}
that may be created, modified, inspected and destroyed. This allows the
programmer to extend the \product{} object-oriented system with new methods
and classes from the host-language. In addition, procedures can be
expressed as objects and then given to \product{} for execution.

The interface between \product{} and its hosting language is small, which
makes \product{} especially a good GUI candidate for special-purpose
languages.

\begin{xpceonly}
The main target language for \product{} is {\em Prolog} and this document
concentrates on \productpl{} rather then \product{}/Lisp or \product{}/C++.
\end{xpceonly}
\productpl{} comes with a graphical programming environment that allows
for quick browsing of the source-code, provides debugging tools and
allows for the graphical construction of {\em dialog boxes} (graphical
windows with {\em controllers}). \product{}'s built-in editor is
modelled after the standard (GNU-)Emacs editor and can be programmed in
\productpl{}.

The reference manual is available in two formats: printed and by means
of the Prolog predicate \ifpw{user_help/0}{manpce/0}. The reference
manual provides detailed descriptions of all classes, methods, etc.\
which may be accessed from various viewpoints. See also
\chapref{online}.
    \tick{PceDraw: An example of using \product{}} \ifpw{}{\cite{XPCE:draw}}
This document contains the annotated sources of the drawing tool PceDraw.
It illustrates the (graphical) functionality of \product{} and is useful as
a source of examples.
    \tick{{\productpl{}} Course Notes} \ifpw{}{\cite{XPCE:course}}
Course-notes, examples and exercises for programming \productpl{}.  The
course-notes have a large overlap in contents with this user guide, but
the material is more concise.  If you are familiar with object-oriented
systems, Prolog and graphical user interfaces the course-notes might
be a quick alternative to this user guide.

\section{Language interfaces}

The interface between \product{} and the application (host) language is
very small. This feature makes it easy to connect \product{} to a new
language. \product{} fits best with dynamically typed or strongly
statically typed languages with type-conversion facilities that can be
programmed. \product{} itself is dynamically typed. Cooperating with
languages with the named properties avoid the need for explicitly
programmed type-conversion. For a dynamically typed host-language such
as Prolog or Lisp, the interface determines the type of the
host-language construct passed and translates it into the corresponding
\product{} object. For \idx{C++}, the rules for translating C data
structures to \product{} objects can be handled by the programmable
type-casting mechanism of C++.

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{SWI-Prolog}
\index{SWI-Prolog (binding)}%
The combination SWI-Prolog/\product{} is the development version. As of
\product{} version 4.8.16, the interface has been changed to use the new
garbage-collection-safe SWI-Prolog foreign language interface.
    \tick{Quintus Prolog}
\index{Quintus Prolog (binding)}%
Distributed by AIIL (UK) under the name ProWindows-3/\product{}.  This version
is commerically supported. See \secref{prowindows}.
    \tick{SICStus Prolog}\index{SICStus Prolog (binding)}%
This binding has been implemented in close cooperation with SICS. Prolog
libraries delivered with \product{} run on Quintus, SICStus and SWI-Prolog.
See also \secref{require}.
    \tick{Lucid Common Lisp 4}
\index{Lucid CommonLisp (binding)}%
The Lisp language binding is described in \cite{XPCE:lisp}. This
interface is no longer maintained.
    \tick{Harlequin LispWorks 3.1}
\index{Harlequin LispWorks (binding)}\index{LispWorks (binding)}%
The Lisp language binding is described in \cite{XPCE:lisp}. This
interface is no longer maintained.
    \tick{GNU-C++ (g++)}
\index{C++ (binding)}\index{g++ (binding)}%
This binding is described in \cite{XPCE:cpp}.  It allows for the
definition of both stand-alone C++/\product{} applications as well as
mixed Prolog/C++/\product{} applications.%
	\footnote{Mixed Lisp/SomeThing/\product{} applications are hard to handle
		  as \product{} atoms are {\sc uppercase} when linked to Lisp.}
\end{itemize}


\section{ProWindows-3}				\label{sec:prowindows}

\index{ProWindows-3}\index{AIIL}%
\product{} is distributed as a commercially supported system for Quintus
Prolog under the name ProWindows-3.  ProWindows-3 is identical to
\product{}, linking the power of the best Prolog implementation with an
advanced and portable GUI toolkit.  ProWindows-3 is distributed and
supported by AIIL.  For further information, please contact:

\section{Portability}

The \product{} virtual machine and built-in class library is written in
standard ANSI-C and is portable to any machine offering a flat,
sufficiently large, memory model (32 or 64 bits). \product{}'s graphical
classes (including windows, etc.) interface to \product{} {\em Virtual
Windows System} (VWS). Currently there are VWS implementations for X11
and the Microsoft Win32 API. \ifpw{}{Please contact the authors if you
are interested in other implementations.}


\subsection{Unix/X-windows}

\ifpw{\product{} runs on all Unix platforms supported by \quintus{}.}{
\index{X-windows}\index{OpenWindows}\index{Motif}
\product{} runs on most Unix/X11 platforms.  Tested platforms include SunOs,
Solaris, AIX, HPUX, IRIX, OSF/1 and Linux.  Platform configuration is
realised using GNU autoconf with an extensive test-suite.}


\subsection{Win32 (Windows 95 and NT)}

\index{Windows 95}\index{Windows NT}
The same binary version of \product{} runs on both Windows~95 and NT.
Its functionality is very close to the Unix/X11 version, making
applications source-code compatible between the two platforms. \ifpw{
Quintus \fileext{qof} files are identical on Unix and Windows platforms,
reducing the effort of porting an applicaction to relinking the
\fileext{qof} files on the target platform}{}.

\product{} does not build on top of the hosting window-systems GUI library.
Instead, the primitive windowing and graphics facilities of the host are
used to implement `\product{}'s Virtual Window System'. All of \product{}'s
graphical functionality is build on top of this `Virtual Window System'.
This approach guarantees full portability of applications between the
platforms.

All good things come with a price-tag and portability based on a virtual
environment is no exception to this rule. \product{} builds high-level
controllers (called dialog-items in its jargon) on top of the virtual
machine and therefore bypasses the graphical libraries of the hosting
system.

The look-and-feel of \product{} may be tailured using the defaults file
located in \file{<pcehome>/Defaults}.


\subsubsection{Currently unsupported features in the Win32 version}

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Class socket]
No support of file-based addressing (Unix domain sockets). Inet-domain
sockets are provided (interfacing to WinSock). Only Windows-NT supports
server sockets. All versions support client sockets.
\end{itemlist}


\subsubsection{Interprocess communication, extensions and interaction}

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [DDE]		\index{DDE}%
Not (yet) supported by \product{}. \ifpw{}{SWI-Prolog supports it
though, making DDE a feasible interprocess communication approach.}
    \item [WinSock]		\index{WinSock}%
On Windows-NT this can be used to connect \productpl{} with other
applications on the same machine. Not on Windows 95 as server-sockets
are not provided on these platforms.
    \item [Named Pipes]		\index{named pipes}%
Not (yet) supported.
    \item [OLE]			\index{OLE}\index{CORBA}%
Not considered yet.  We however are considering CORBA, which provides
an open standard for object-oriented, network-transparent interprocess
communications.  CORBA and OLE are integrated.
    \item [Drag-And-Drop]	\index{drag-and-drop}%
\product{} can accept dropped files from other applications. Inside the
application, drag-and-drop is fully compatible to the Unix version.
See \pllib{dragdrop}.
    \item [Cut/Paste]		\index{cut-and-paste}%
Supported for exchanging text, and pictures using the Windows MetaFile
format.
    \item [DLL]			\index{DLL}%
Not supported by \product{}. \ifpw{\quintus{} provides}{Both SWI-Prolog
and \quintus{} provide} it though, making DLL available to \productpl{}
applications.
\end{itemlist}


\subsubsection{Accessing Windows Graphics Resources}

\product{} on Win32 defines the same cursor, colour and font-names as the
Unix/X11 version to guarantee portability. It is desirable to have
access to all the native Windows graphical resources. This allows the
application to maintain better look-and-feel compatibility to other
Win32 applications. Therefore the classes colour, cursor and font
provide access to related Window resources.

\strong{It is NOT adviced to use these objects in your application code
directly as this will stop the application to run on the Unix/X11
version of \product{}. We advice using these objects in the \product{}
defaults file (\file{<pcehome>/Defaults}) only, or use conditional code
using `pce <-window_system'.}


\subsubsection{Accessing Windows Colours}

Colours may be created from their X11 names. The X11 name-table is in
\file{<pcehome>/lib/rgb.txt}. In the Windows API, all colours described
as \idx{RGB} (Red, Green, Blue) tuples. This is no problem as \product{}
also provides RGB colors. Note however that Win32 intensity is ranged
0..255, where the \product{} intensity is ranged 0..65535. This is true
on all \product{}'s platforms.

To provide access to the window-system colours as they can be obtained
using the Win32 API function GetSysColor(), \product{} binds these
colours to named colour objects. These colour objects are normally used
in the \product{} resource file (\file{<pcehome>/Pce}) to colour
\product{}'s controller objects acording to the user's preferences.

If the name of the Windows API colours are COLOR_SOMETHING, the \product{}
name is \const{win_something}.  The full list is in \tabref{wincolours}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularlp}{\const{win_inactivecaptiontext}}
\hline
\const{win_activeborder}	& Active window border.\\
\const{win_activecaption}	& Active window caption.\\
\const{win_appworkspace}	& Background color of (MDI) applications.\\
\const{win_background}		& Desktop.\\
\const{win_btnface}		& Face shading on push buttons.\\
\const{win_btnshadow}		& Edge shading on push buttons.\\
\const{win_btntext}		& Text on push buttons.\\
\const{win_captiontext}		& Text in caption and size box\\
\const{win_graytext}		& Grayed (disabled) text.\\

\const{win_windowtext}		& Text in windows.\\
\hline
\end{tabularlp}
\end{center}
\caption{Windows colour name mapping}
\label{tab:wincolours}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Accessing Windows Fonts}			\label{sec:winfont}

The normal screen, helvetica, roman and times font families available in
the Unix/X11 version are available using the same names. The system will
try to use an as close as possible equivalent Windows TrueType font for
these.

The Windows `stock' fonts as available from the GetStockObject() API are
available under the special `family' "win". They are in
\tabref{winfonts}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularlp}{\const{win_inactivecaptiontext}}
\hline
\tt font(win, ansi_fixed)	& Default ANSI encoded fixed font\\
\tt font(win, ansi_var)		& Default ANSI encoded variable font\\
\tt font(win, device_default)	& Default device font\\
\tt font(win, oem_fixed)	& Computers `native' fixed font (PC)\\
\tt font(win, system)		& Variable pitched system font\\
\tt font(win, system_fixed)	& Fixed system font\\
\hline
\end{tabularlp}
\end{center}
\caption{Windows font name mapping}
\label{tab:winfonts}
\end{table}


Note that these  fonts  do  not   have  a  specified  point-size.  Their
point-size depends on the Windows installation.  The get-method <-points
will return the <-height of the font.

Other Windows fonts may be accessed using a similar method as in
Unix/X11: provide a fourth argument describing the font using the hosts
conventions. For the Win32 API, this is a textual description of the
Windows API structure LOGFONT passed to CreateFontIndirect(). The
description is a `:' (colon) separated list of attributes of the
structure. The attributes need not be specified in the order of the
structure-layout. Omited attributes are set to their default.

Attributes come in four types: numeric, boolean, enumerated and string.
In general, an attribute is specified as: \line{<name>(<value>)} <name>
is matches case-insensitive against the name of the structure field
without the leading `lf' string. For numeric types, the argument is
interpreted as a decimal number (spaces are not allowed). For a boolean
argument, the (value) part is omited. By default the boolean attributes
are FALSE. Including the attribute name in the specification sets the
field to TRUE. Enumerated fields are specified using their symbolic
name. Name-matching is case-insensitive. Common parts of the API
identifier to make the symbol unique (for example _CHARSET in
ANSI_CHARSET) are removed. String arguments simply take the value
between the brackets. Spaces are included in the output, case is not
changed and there is no escape for the closing-brace.

The default settings are in \tabref{winfontdefaults}, the attributes are
in \tabref{winfontattributes}.
	
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularlp}{\const{win_inactivecaptiontext}}
\hline
\const{charset}		& ansi \\
\const{height}		& $<points> \times font.scale$ \\
\const{weigth}		& bold if <style> is bold, normal otherwise \\
\const{italic}		& TRUE if <style> is italic or oblique \\
\const{pitch}		& fixed if <family> is screen \\
\const{family}		& swiss if <family> is helvetica, 
			  roman if <family> is times,
			  modern if <family> is screen
			  dontcare otherwise. \\
\const{face}		& <family> \\
\hline
\end{tabularlp}
\end{center}
\caption{Windows font defaults}
\label{tab:winfontdefaults}
\end{table}


\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularlp}{\const{win_inactivecaptiontext}}
\hline
\const{height}(int)	& point-size of the requested font \\
\const{width}(int)	& average width of the characters \\
\const{escapement}(int) & angle in 1/10 degrees of the baseline \\
\const{orientation}(int)& angle for each character \\
\const{weigth}(int)	& 0..1000 scale for thickness \\
\const{italic}		& request italic look \\
\const{underline}	& underline all characters \\
\const{strikeout}	& use strikeout-fonts \\
\const{charset}(enum)	& character encoding
			  \nameof{ansi, oem, symbol} \\
\const{outprecision}(enum)& accurate aspects
			\nameof{character, default, string, stroke} \\
\const{clipprecision}(enum)& how the characters clip
			\nameof{character, default, stroke} \\
\const{quality}(enum)	& Quality of output
			\nameof{default, draft, proof} \\
\const{pitch}(enum)	& Spacing attributes
			\nameof{default, fixed, variable} \\
\const{family}(enum)	& Style of the characters
			  \nameof{decorative, dontcare, modern,
				  roman, script, swiss}\\
\const{face}(string)    & Use specific font database \\
\hline
\end{tabularlp}
\end{center}
\caption{Windows font attributes}
\label{tab:winfontattributes}
\end{table}


The following example binds the Windows `WingDings' symbol-font:

\begin{code}
1 ?- new(F, font(wingdings, roman, 20, 'charset(symbol)')).
\end{code}

The following example uses this  font  to   create  an  image from such a
character:

\begin{code}
:- send(@display, font_alias, wingdings,
	font(wingdings, roman, 20, 'charset(symbol)')).

wingding_image(Index, Image) :-
	new(Image, image(@nil, 32, 32)),
	new(T, text(string('%c', Index), center, wingdings)),
	send(T, center, point(16, 16)),
	send(Image, draw_in, T),
	send(T, done).

test :-
	wingding_image(60, Floppy),
	send(label(test, Floppy), open).
\end{code}


\subsubsection{Accessing Windows Cursors}

The Win32 version of \product{} supports all the X11 cursors. It also
supports the definition of cursors from images. Note that such cursors
are generally limited to $32 \times 32$ pixels on Windows (formally
there is no limit in X11, but many (colour) servers exhibit strange
behaviour when given cursors larger than this size). The window cursor
names are in \tabref{wincursors}. Use the File/Demo/Cursors entry from
the PCE Manual to inspect all available cursors.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularlp}{\const{win_inactivecaptiontext}}
\hline
\const{win_arrow}	& Default Windows arrow\\
\const{win_ibeam}	& Like xterm\\
\const{win_wait}	& hour-class (good replacement of `watch')\\
\const{win_cross}	& like crosshair\\
\const{win_uparrow}	& long up arrow (no good X11 replacement)\\
\const{win_size}	& A bit like `fleur'\\
\const{win_icon}	& (see icon and icon_cross)\\
\const{win_sizenwse}	& NorthWest - SouthEast arrow (no X11 replacement)\\
\const{win_sizenesw}	& NorthEast - SouthWest arrow\\
\const{win_sizewe}	& West - East arrow\\
\const{win_sizens}	& North - South arrow\\
\const{win_sizeall}	& as win_size\\
\const{win_no}		& Stop-sign\\
\const{win_appstarting}	& Arrow with hour-class\\
\hline
\end{tabularlp}
\end{center}
\caption{Windows cursor name mapping}
\label{tab:wincursors}
\end{table}

The default \file{Pce} resource file assigns \const{win_arrow} as the
default cursor under Windows. \const{win_ibeam} is the default editor
cursor and \const{win_wait} is the default wait cursor.
  

\section{Look-and-feel}

\index{look-and-feel}\index{Motif}\index{OpenWindows}%
\product{} is not implemented on top of a standard UI library such as
Motif, OpenWindows, or Win32. Instead, it is built on top of its own VWS
defining primitives to create and manipulate windows, draw primitives
such as lines, circles, text and handle user-events.

As a consequence, \product{} programs are fully compatible over the available
platforms, except that some (almost exclusively obscure) features may
have a different or have no effect on some implementations.

The implementation of all of \product{} on top of its primitive
graphicals guarantees there are no platform-specific limitations in the
manipulation and semantics of certain controllers. \product{} defines
the look-and-feel for each of the controllers. As a consequence,
\product{} controllers may not behave exactly the same as controllers of
other applications in the same windowing environment. 

The visual feedback (look) and to some extend the reactions to user
actions (feel) of the \product{} controllers is determined by
\product{}'s {\em defaults} file, located in \file{<pcehome>/Defaults}.
See \secref{classvar}.


\begin{xpceonly}
\section{A brief history of (X)PCE}

The ``PCE Project'' was started in 1985 by Anjo Anjewierden.  His aim
was to develop a high-level UI environment for (C-)Prolog.  The
requirements for this environment came from the ``Thermodynamics Coach''
project in which Paul Kamsteeg used PCE/Prolog to implement the UI for
a courseware system for thermodynamics.  This system included a
`scratch-pad' that allowed the student to create structured drawings
of component configurations. The application had to be able to analyse
the drawing made by the student.

PCE has been redesigned and largely re-implemented on a SUN workstation
using Quintus Prolog and later SWI-Prolog \cite{SWI-Prolog:manual} in
the Esprit project P1098 (KADS).  This project used PCE to implement a
knowledge engineering workbench called Shelley
\cite{Anjewierden:90b}.  During this period PCE/Prolog has been used by
various research groups to implement graphical interfaces for
applications implemented in Prolog.  Most of these interfaces stressed
the use of \idx{direct-manipulation} graphical interfaces. Feedback
from these projects has made PCE generally useful and mature.

This document describes version 4.9 of \product{}. Version 4 is a major
release. During the versions 4.0 to 4.5, \product{} was moved from SunView to
X-windows and since 4.7 to the Win32 platform. In addition, the virtual
machine has been made available to the application programmer, allowing
for the definition of new \product{} classes. These versions have been used
mainly for small internal case-studies to validate the new approach.
Larger-scale external usage started from version 4.6 and introduced the
vital requirement to reduce incompatible changes to the absolute
minimum.
\end{xpceonly}

\begin{pwonly}
\section{A brief history of \product{}}

The basic design underlying \product{} was developed for an internal
project at the University of Amsterdam by Anjo Anjewierden. It was
further developed in `Esprit' project P1098 (KADS-I) for the realisation
of a workbench for knowledge engineering (Shelley).  PCE 2.0, as the
system was called then was commercialised by Quintus as ProWindows 1.

Development of PCE continued in the academic environment, producing
XPCE-3, and later XPCE-4. In this process, the system was ported from
SunView to X11 and Win32. Controllers and basic graphicals were unified,
the class-system was made available to the user and user-defined classes
were introduced. Performance, robustness and programming environment
were improved drastically.

XPCE-4 was brought to the attention of James Little (AIIL) by Paul
Holmes-Higgin from Surrey University.  AIIL decided to commercialise
XPCE-4 using the name `ProWindows-3', and introduce it as the portable
Quintus GUI environment.

\section{About this manual}

This userguide introduces the basics of \productpl{} and its development
environment. \Chapref{starting} and \chapref{globalarch}, ``Getting
Started'' and ``Global Architecture'' explain the interface and provide
a global overview of the \productpl{} hybrid environment.
\Chapref{online}, ``Using the online manual'' introduces the online
documentation tools. These are introduced early, as many of the examples
in this manual introduce classes and methods without explaining them.
The online manual tool can be used to find the definitions of these
constructs quickly. The \chapref{graphics} and \chapref{controller},
``Dialog (controller) windows'' and ``Simple Graphics'' introduce the
various controller and graphical primitives. \Chapref{dialogeditor},
``The Dialog Editor'' introduces the tool to built controller windows
with the mouse. 

With the material of the above described chapters, the user is
sufficiently informed to create simple GUI's from predefined \product{}
objects.  The remaining chapters provide the background information
and techniques that allow for the design of larger graphical systems.

\Chapref{pceprolog}, ``The relation between \product{} and Prolog'' is a
brief intermezzo, explaining the relation between \product{} and Prolog
data in more detail. \Chapref{udc}, ``User defined classes'' explain the
definition of new \product{} classes from Prolog and thus brings
object-oriented programming to the user. \Chapref{techniques},
``Programming techniques'' is an assorted collection of hints on how
\product{} can be used to solve real-world problems elegantly.

\Chapref{debugging}, ``Development and debugging tools'' introduces
the \product{} debugger.  The current debugger is powerful, but not very
intuitive and requires a nice-looking front-end.

Of the appendices, \appref{summary} is probably the most
useful, providing a short description of each class and its relation
to other classes.  Many of the classes are accompanied with a
small example.

\section{Acknowledgements}

The development of \product{} was  started by Anjo Anjewierden.  The package
was  then called PCE.  He designed  and implemented  version  1 and 2.
Version 3 is the result of a joint effort by Anjo Anjewierden and Jan
Wielemaker.

XPCE-4, offering support for X-windows and user-defined classes, has
been implemented by Jan Wielemaker. The implementation of user-defined
classes was initiated when Jan Wielemaker was guest at SERC (Software
Engineering Research Centre). Gert Florijn has contributed in the
initial discussions on user-defined classes. Frans Heeman has been the
first user.

The interface to SICStus Prolog has been implemented in cooperation with
Stefan Andersson and Mats Carlsson from SICS.

The interface to Quintus Prolog was initiated by Paul-Holmes Higgins.  The
project was realised by James Little, Mike Vines and Simon Heywood
from AIIL.

Luca Passani has bothered us with many questions, but was so kind to
organise this material and make it available to other \product{} programmers
in the form of a FAQ.
