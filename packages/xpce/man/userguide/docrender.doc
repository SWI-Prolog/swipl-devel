\section{Document rendering primitives}		\label{sec:docrender}

Dynamic HTML has enabled the presentation of user interfaces as
documents the user can interact with.  None of the traditional
GUI components can deal with the mixture of properly formatted
text with (interactive) graphics.  \product{} provides support
using a set of primitive classes that realise a box-model based
on \TeX.  This basic model is enhanced using a Prolog library
providing HTML-based primitives.  First we will introduce the
basics.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Class \class{parbox}]
This is the central class of the document-rendering support.  It is
a subclass of \class{device}, placing \class{hbox} objects as words
within a paragraph.  Parbox devices have a <->width, realise alignment
and adjustment and can place text around \jargon{floating} objects.

    \item [Class \class{hbox}]
This is an abstract super-class for \class{tbox} and \class{grbox}
that allow for text and graphics within a \class{parbox}.

    \item [Class \class{tbox}]
Represent text in a \class{parbox}.  Normally, a \class{tbox} represents
a word.

    \item [Class \class{grbox}]
Embeds any \class{graphical} object in a \class{parbox}. The
\class{grbox} negotiates with the \class{parbox} on the placement and
then places the graphical on the \class{parbox} using normal behaviour
of \class{device}.

    \item [Class \class{lbox}]
This is another subclass of \class{device} that realises \LaTeX-like 
list-environment.  The class deals with placement of labels and text for
the items.  Both label and item are arbitrary graphical objects.  Items
are normally instances of \class{parbox}.

    \item [Class \class{rubber}]
This is a data object containing information on the
\jargon{stretchability} of boxes.  Rubber object are used to distribute
space horizontally as well as to determine the location of line-breaks.
A space in a \class{parbox} is realised using a \class{hbox} whose
natrual width is the width of a space in the current \class{font} that
can shrink a little and expand a bit easier.
\end{itemlist}

Before discussing the library we show a small example using the
primitives directly.

\begin{pcecode}
parbox :-
	send(new(W, window), open),
	send(W, display, new(P, parbox(W?width)), point(10,10)),
	send(W, resize_message, message(P, width, @arg2?width-20)),
	
	send(P, alignment, justify),
	send_list(P,
		  [ append(grbox(box(40,40), left)),
		    cdata('This is the central class of the '),
		    cdata('document-rendering support.  It is '),
		    cdata('a subclass of '),
		    cdata('device', style(underline := @on)),
		    cdata(', placing '),
		    cdata('hbox', style(underline := @on)),
		    cdata(' objects as words within a paragraph. '),
		    cdata('Parbox devices have a <->width, realise '),
		    cdata('alignment and adjustment and can place text '),
		    cdata('around '),
		    cdata('floating ', style(font := italic)),
		    cdata(' objects.')
		  ]).
\end{pcecode}

\postscriptfig{parbox1}{A parbox floating text around a box}

In line 4, we forward changes to the width of the window to the
\class{parbox} to force reformatting the text if the width of the
window changes.  Line 6 asks for a straight right-margin.  Line 8
appends a \class{box} that is left aligned, the text floating around
it.  The remaining lines append text.  The method `parbox->cdata'
breaks the argument into words and adds instances of \class{tbox}
for each word, separated by instances of \class{hbox} with appropriate
\class{rubber} for each sequence of white-space, doing much the same
as an HTML browser processing \const{CDATA} text.

Defining a document from Prolog text using these primitives is not
attractive.   This is the motivation for using a library.


\subsection{The rendering library}		\label{sec:docemit}

The directory \file{<pcehome>/prolog/lib/doc} contains the
document-rendering library, providing HTML-oriented primitives for
document rendering.  The translation process can be extended by
defining predicates for two \jargon{multifile} predicates.

The central library is \pllib{doc/emit}.  This library defines the
predicate emit/3:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{emit}{3}{+ListOfTerm, +PBox, +Mode}
This predicate takes a list of processing instructions and applies
these on \arg{PBox}, an instance of class \class{pbox}, a subclass of
\class{parbox} supporting this library. \arg{Mode} provides an instance
of \class{doc_mode}, a data-object holding style-information.

\arg{ListOfTerm} consists of the following instructions:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [<Atomic>]
Atomic data is added as text to the output.  If `doc_mode<-space_mode'
equals \const{preserve}, spaces are preserved.  Otherwise space is
canonised, smashing multiple consecutive banks into a single (rubber)
space.

    \item [\bsl{}Action]
Execute an \arg{Action}.  Actions are like \TeX{} commands, which is
why we use the backslash.  The built-in actions and the definition of
new actions is discussed in \secref{docactions}.

    \item [@Object]
\product{} objects are simply appended to the \class{pbox}.  This can
be used to append self-created objects or use one of the predefined
layout objects defined in \secref{docobjects}.
\end{itemlist}

Before handed to the above, emit/3 calls the multifile predicate
doc:emit/3 passing the whole list as you can see from the definition
below. This allows the user-hook to process sequences of instructions.

\begin{code}
emit(Term, PB, Mode) :-
        doc:emit(Term, PB, Mode), !.
\end{code}
\end{description}

\subsection{Predefined objects}			\label{sec:docobjects}

The file \pllib{doc/objects} defines a number of globally named
instances of the box classes.  Appending these objects is like executing
an action.  These objects are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{0.7\linewidth}}
@br	& Nul-dimension \class{hbox} with rubber to force a line-break. \\
@nbsp	& Non-breaking space. \\
@hfill	& Rubber \class{hbox} for alignment and centering. \\
@space_rubber & Rubber used for \class{hbox} objects representing a
	  space.  This rubber allows for a line-break. \\
@h<n>_above & Space above HTML section-headers. \\
@h<n>_below & Space below HTML section-headers. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Class and method reference}		\label{sec:docreference}

This section provides a partial reference to the classes and methods
defining the document-rendering library.  For full information, please
use the {\sf ClassBrowser} and check the source-code.

\begin{description}
    \sendmethod{pbox}{show}{Content:prolog, Mode:[doc_mode]}
Calls emit/3 using \arg{Content} and \arg{Mode}.  If mode is omitted,
a default mode object is created.

    \sendmethod{pbox}{event}{Event:event}
Handles clicking a button or footnote and showing \jargon{balloons} from
buttons after trying to pass the event to one of the embedded
graphicals.

    \getmethod{pbox}{anchor}{Name}{tuple(Box, Index)}
Return the \arg{Box} and index thereof in the `parbox<-content' vector
that starts the named anchor (see \secref{docactions}.

    \sendmethod{doc_mode}{initialise}{}
Creates a default document-rendering mode.  This mode has the following
properties:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{llp{0.5\linewidth}}
\bf vfont & new(vfont) & The \jargon{virtual} font for text \\
\bf link_colour & dark_green & Text-colour while rendering buttons \\
\bf parsep & hbox(0,8) & Skip 8 pixels between paragraphs \\
\bf parindent & hbox(0,0) & Do not indent paragraphs \\
\bf space_mode & canonical & Collapse spaces \\
\bf alignment & justify & Make a right-margin \\
\bf base_url & '' & URL for HTML hyper-links \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \sendmethod{doc_mode}{set_font}{Att:name, Value:any}
Set an attribute of <-vfont and update <-style and <-space to
reflect the new font-settings.

    \sendmethod{doc_mode}{colour}{Colour}
Set the colour of <-style.

    \sendmethod{doc_mode}{underline}{Bool}
Set underline mode in <-style.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Class \class{vfont}}

The class \class{vfont} realises \jargon{virtual} fonts, Microsoft also
calls these \jargon{logical} fonts. \product{} \class{font} objects are
read-only. When dealing with incremental font manipulation it is
necessary to have a font that can be manipulated. Therefore,
\class{vfont} defines a number of slots to represent the font attributes
regardless of the fonts existence. At any time the user can request the
best matching font using `vfont<-font'. The mapping between virtual font
attributes and physical fonts can be programmed by adding clauses to the
multifile predicate vfont:font_map/7. This class is defined in
\pllib{doc/vfont} where you find further programming details. 


\subsubsection{Rendering actions}		\label{sec:docactions}

The action subsystem processes actions (\bsl{}Action) from emit/3,
providing a hook for adding new actions.  Before doing anything else,
the hook doc:action/3 is called:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{doc:action}{3}{+Action, +PBox, +Mode}
Execute \arg{Action}. The actions are passed from emit/3 after stripping
the backslash.  If this hook succeeds the action is considered handled.
\end{description}

The built-in actions are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{ignorespaces}{}
Tells emit/3 eat all input until the first action or non-blank
character.

    \termitem{space}{SpaceMode}
Tells emit/3 to \const{preserve} white-space or render it
\const{canonical}.  Default is \class{canonical}.

    \termitem{pre}{Text}
Add verbatim text.

    \termitem{par}{}
Start a new paragraph. This is the action-sequence \const{parskip},
followed by \const{parsep}.

    \termitem{parskip}{}
Inserts <-parsep from the current mode, surrounded by two line-breaks
(@br).

    \termitem{parindent}{}
Insert the <-parindent from the current mode.

    \termitem{group}{Group}
Use emit/3 on \arg{Group} on a <-clone of the \class{doc_mode} object.
This is essentially the same as a \TeX{} group, scoping changes to the
mode such as font-changes, etc.

    \termitem{setfont}{Attribute, Value}
Set an attribute of the font.  Fonts are maintained using the Prolog
defined class \class{vfont} (\jargon{virtual} font) that allows for
independent changes to font attributes.  When text needs to be rendered,
a close real font is mounted.  Defined attributes are:
\const{family}, \const{encoding}, \const{slant}, \const{weight},
\const{fixed} and \const{size}. See
\file{<pcehome>/prolog/lib/doc/vfont.pl} for details.

    \termitem{ul}{}
Switch on underlining.  Normally this should be inside a group to
limit the scope.

    \termitem{colour}{Colour}
Set the text-colour.

    \termitem{list}{Options, Content}
Produce a list-environment.  The option \term{class}{Class} defines the
subclass of \class{lbox} used to instantiate, default
\class{bullet_list}.  The \arg{Content} is passed to emit/3, using the
created list-object as 2nd argument.

When using a \class{bullet_list} or \class{enum_list} \arg{Content} must
translated into a sequence of \const{li} commands. Using a
\class{definition_list}, a sequence of \const{dt} and \const{dd}
commands is expected.

    \termitem{li}{Content}
If we are processing a \class{bullet_list} or \class{enum_list}, start a
new item using `<-make_item', then emit \arg{Content} to the new item.

    \termitem{dt}{ItemTitle}
If we are processing a \class{definition_list}, create a new label from
\arg{ItemTitle}.

    \termitem{dd}{ItemContent}
Create a \class{pbox} for the item body and emit \arg{ItemContent} to
it.

    \termitem{title}{Title}
Get the <-frame of the \class{pbox} and send it the given title using
`frame->label'.

    \termitem{body}{Options}
Apply options to the window as a whole.  Defines options are
\term{bgcolour}{Colour}, \term{background}{Image} and
\term{text}{Colour}.

    \termitem{button}{Message, Content, Balloon}
Add an active area (hyper-link) to the document. When depressed,
\arg{Message} is executed.  When hoovering, \arg{Balloon} is reported
as status (see \secref{report}).  \arg{Content} is emitted inside a
group after setting the default colour to `doc_mode<-link_colour' and
underlining to @on.

    \termitem{anchor}{Label, Content}
Label some content.  This has no visual implications, but the the anchor
can be located using `pbox<-anchor'.

    \termitem{parbox}{Content, Options}
Add a sub-parbox.  Defined options are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{width}{Width}
Define the width of the sub-box.
	\termitem{rubber}{Rubber}
Define the shrink- and stretchability of the sub-box.
	\termitem{align}{Alignment}
Define text-adjustment
(\const{left},\const{center},\const{right},\const{justify}) within the
box.
	\termitem{valign}{VAlign}
Define the vertical alignment of the box (\const{top}, \const{center},
\const{bottom}.

	\termitem{auto_crop}{Bool}
If @on, tell the \class{pbox} its <-area is determined by the
content rather than the specified width.  Text may be formatted
left-to-write without wrapping by defining a wide parbox and using
this option.
    \end{description}

    \termitem{table}{Options, Content}
Create a tabular layout using the class \class{doc_table}, a
\class{device} holding a \class{table}.  See also \secref{tabular}.
The options and commands are modelled after HTML-3.  Table-related
commands are \const{tr}, \const{td}, \const{col}, \const{thead} and
\const{tbody}.  Defined options are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{align}{Align}
Graphical alignment, allowing placement as \const{left} or \const{right}
floating object or \const{center}ed placement.
	\termitem{width}{Width}
Give the table a specified width.
	\termitem{bgcolor}{Colour}
Set the default background colour for the rows, columns and cells.
	\termitem{cellpadding}{IntOrSize}
Specify the space inside a cell around its content.
	\termitem{cellspacing}{IntOrSize}
Specify the space between cells.
    \end{description}

    \termitem{tr}{}
Open the next table-row.

    \termitem{tr}{Options, Content}
Open a new row and emit \arg{Content} therein.  \arg{Options} are
applied to the row.  See class \class{table_row} for details.

    \termitem{td}{Options, Content}
Add a table-cell and emit \arg{Content} into it.  \arg{Options} are
applied to the new cell.  See class \class{table_cell} for details.

    \termitem{col}{Options}
Handle an HTML-3 \const{col} element, specifying parameters for the
next column.  Defined \arg{Options} are \term{span}{Span} to apply
these settings to the next \arg{Span} columns and \term{width}{Spec},
where \arg{Spec} is an integer (pixels) or a term \term{*}{N}, defining
the weight for shrinking and stretching relative to other columns using
this notation.  The following defines the second column to be twice
as wide as the first:

\begin{code}
	[ \col(*(1)),
	  \col(*(2))
	]
\end{code}

    \termitem{tbody}{Options}
Start a row-group.  See `table_row->end_group'.  \arg{Options} is
currently ignored.

    \termitem{thead}{Options, Content}
Handle a table-head.  It expects a number of rows in \arg{Content}.
While processing \arg{Content} it sets the default cell alignment
to \const{center} and font to \const{bold}.

    \termitem{footnote}{Content}
Add a footnote-mark.  Pressing the mark shows a popup-window holding
the text of the footnote.

    \termitem{preformatted}{Text}
Adds \arg{text} in a \class{tbox} to the parbox	without checking the
content.  The current style is applied to \arg{Text}
\end{description}


\subsection{Using the ``doc/emit'' library}

In \secref{docemit} and \secref{docactions} we have seen the definition
of the basic rendering library infrastructure.  It uses concepts from
\TeX{} and HTML-3, introducing primitives for grouping, attribute
settings, lists, tables and whitespace-handling.

The emit/3 predicate as described above is not intended for direct use
though.  It is hard to imagine a good syntax for defining significant
amounts of formatted text in a Prolog text-file.  In some cases it is
feasible to define a suitable set of new commands and use emit/3
direcly from Prolog.  In most cases you'll want to use tokens from an
external source using an external markup language.

One option to arrive at a token-list is using the XML/SGML parser
included in SWI-Prolog.  It can be used either with a domain-specific
DTD, in which case you need to define the translations by hand or using
an HTML DTD, in which case the library \pllib{doc/html} defines the
required translations.

We will illustrate this in a small example.  First the code to show
HTML inside a window is below.  In line 1 we load the always-needed
document rendering infra-structure and register the \const{doc}
search-path to reflect the \file{<pcehome>/prolog/lib/doc} directory.
Next we import emit/3 and load the HTML-rendering extensions to
doc:emit/3 and doc:action/3.

\begin{pcecode}
:- use_module(library('doc/load')).
:- use_module(doc(emit)).
:- use_module(doc(html)).
:- use_module(library(sgml)).

show_html(File) :-
	send(new(P, picture), open),
	send(P, display, new(PB, pbox), point(10,10)),
	send(P, resize_message, message(PB, width, @arg2?width - 20)),
	
	load_html_file(File, Tokens),
	send(PB, show, Tokens).
\end{pcecode}

Here is the HTML code loaded and the visual result.

\begin{code}
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">

<html>  
  <head>  
    <title>Document rendering</title>
  </head>  
<body>
<h1>SWI-Prolog SGML-DOM</h1>

<p>
SWI-Prolog 4.0 provides a library for loading XML, SGML and
HTML files and convert them to a complex Prolog term.  This
term has the format

<p>
<pre>
element(Name,
        ListOfNameValue
        ListOfContent)
</pre>

<p>
Where <var/ListOfNameValue/ reflects the attribute-list of the
element and <var/ListOfContent/ is mixed list of atoms representing
<em/CDATA/ and <b>element/3</b> terms representing nested elements.
</body>
</html>
\end{code}

\postscriptfig{dochtml}{Rendering HTML code}

In general you do not want to render plain HTML using \productpl{} as it
is far less flexible than real browsers dealing with errornous HTML, the
implementation of HTML is incomplete and it supports Java nor
Javascript.

It has proved to be worthwile using the extensibility of SGML and this
layout to render domain-specific documents, often using HTML elements
for the basic layout.
