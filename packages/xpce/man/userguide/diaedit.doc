\chapter{The dialog editor}			\label{sec:dialogeditor}

\index{controls,GUI tool for}%
The dialog editor is a GUI based tool for the definition of dialog
windows (windows with controls). It supports the following phases of the
definition of a GUI:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{Specifying the required controls}
Prototypes of controls are dragged to the {\em target} dialog window.
They are moved to---roughly---the right location.
    \tick{Refining the controls}
The controls may be refined: specifying labels, sizes, fonts, items in
menus, etc.
    \tick{Fixing the layout and size of the window}
The layout specification for the dialog window is established. The
Dialog Editor guesses the layout intentions of the user and translates
these into XPCE's dialog-window symbolic layout statements.
    \tick{Specifying behaviour}
Both internal behaviour and the link to the application may be
established using graphics.  The dialog may be tested, while graphical
animation illustrates how user-actions are processed and transferred to
the application.
    \tick{Generation of code}
A Prolog description of the dialog window is realised by dragging the
dialog from the list of dialog-windows to a PceEmacs window running
in Prolog mode.
    \tick{Linking the dialog in the application}
The generated code is a clause of the predicate dialog/2.  The first
argument of this clause {\em identifies} the dialog, while the second
arguments describes the structure and behaviour of the dialog.  The
body is empty. The library predicate make_dialog/2 is used to create a
dialog window from the description of dialog/2.
\end{itemize}

\section{Guided tour}

We will now illustrate the functionality of the Dialog Editor by
defining a simple prompt dialog that asks for a name and has an {\sf ok}
and {\sf cancel} button to confirm or cancel the operation.  The result
is shown in \figref{diaaskname}

\postscriptfig{diaaskname}{Ask-name dialog generated by the Dialog Editor}

\subsection{Creating the target dialog window}

First, start the manual tools using manpce/0 or user_help/0.  Then, start
the dialog editor using the option {\sf Tools/Dialog Editor}.  The main
window of the dialog editor is now opened on the screen.  Use the option
{\sf File/New Dialog} and enter the name `ask_name'.  This will add ask_name
to the Dialog Windows browser and open an window with the title `Ask Name'.
See \figref{diaeditor1}.  This window is called the `target window'.

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{diaeditor1}{The Dialog Editor with the ask-name target}

\subsection{Adding controls to the new window}

Next, the controls are dragged to the dialog window.  The control marked
\psfig{figure=figs/textitemicon.eps,height=2ex} specifies a
text-entry-field. Drag this icon using the left-mouse button to the
target dialog. If the mouse is above the target dialog, a dotted box
will indicate the outline of the new item when it is dropped. Drop it in
about the right location. Now drag two instances of
\psfig{figure=figs/buttonicon.eps,height=2ex} to the target dialog and
place them again at about the right location. Items can be moved by
dragging them with the left button. They can also be {\bf copied} to
other target dialog windows by dragging them there and they can be {\bf
deleted} by dragging them to the window holding the prototypes.

Now, double-click, using the left button, the text-entry field.  A
dialog with attributes will appear.  The caret is positioned at the {\sf
Name} field.  Clear the name field (Control-U is the fastest way) and
enter {\tt name}, followed by RETURN.  The system will automatically
fill the {\sf Label} field with {\sf Name} (capitalising the name of the
control).  If the label should be anything else than the capitalised
name, type the correct label now.  The other fields are
self-explanatory, except for the {\sf Type} field.  This specifies the
type of object edited by the text-entry field.  See `text_item <->type'
for details.  Pressing {\sf Help} creates a window containing the online
manual cards of all displayed attributes.

Double click on both buttons to fix the name/label.  Assign the ok button
to be the default button.  The result is shown in \figref{diaeditor2}.

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{diaeditor2}{The Dialog Editor after specifying attributes}


\subsection{Defining the layout}

Next, the {\sf Mode} menu of the main Dialog Editor window is used to
select {\sf Layout Mode}.  The button {\sf Layout} guesses the symbolic
layout description of the dialog and places the items.  If you are not
satisfied with the result, press {\sf Undo}.  Next, you can help the
layout mechanism by positioning the items closer to the intended
position and try again, or place the items by hand.  In the latter case,
the generated code will express the layout using pixel-locations rather
then a symbolic description and the result may look bad if the end-user
runs XPCE with a different look-and-feel.  The {\sf Fit} button adjusts
the size of the dialog window to its content.


\subsection{Specifying the behaviour}

The next step is to specify the {\em behaviour} of the dialog window.
Select the {\sf Action} mode and press the {\sf Behaviour Model} button
to open the behaviour window.  Now drag all items from the target dialog
window to the behaviour window.

Each control is now represented by a behavioural component.  Each such
component defines a number of {\em ports}. The Dialog Editor
distinguishes between three types of ports:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{send-port}
\index{send,port}%
A send-port is the representation of a send-method defined on the
controller represented by the behavioural component.
    \tick{get-port}
\index{get,port}%
A get-port is the representation of a get-method defined on the
controller.
    \tick{event-port}
\index{event,port}%
An event-port is the representation of an instance variable defined on
the controller that can hold an executable (\class{code}) object
(see \secref{exeobjects}).  Controls use these variables to define the
{\em callback} actions of the dialog item.
\end{itemize}

The window (background) represents the {\em target} dialog as a whole.
Ports may be added to both behavioural components and the background
window using the popup menu associated with the right mouse-button.

While hovering over the various parts of the behavioural model, the
feedback window at the bottom describes the meaning of the current item.
The popup menus defined on all components of the model provide
context-sensitive access to the XPCE online manual as well as the online
documentation of the Dialog Editor.

In general, the action(s) associated with a control are specified by
connecting its event-ports to a send-port in the diagram. The line
connecting both ports has a fat dot in the middle. Get-ports may be
linked to this fat dot to specify {\em arguments} for the
send-operation. If a get-method needs to be performed on the value of a
get-port to define the argument, {\sf Extend} the get-port, define a new
get-port on the extension and link the result to the argument dot.

For our {\sf Ask Name} dialog, we need to make a {\em modal} dialog, see
\secref{modal}. Such a dialog returns by invoking the ->return method on
the dialog window.   The popup of the background is used to define a
send-port named {\tt return}, representing ->return to the dialog.
Position the pointer above the new item to validate your action.

Now, as both methods will make the dialog return immediately, link the
{\tt message} event-port of both buttons to this {\tt return} send-port.
Link the {\tt selection} get-port of the text field to the argument dot
of the link from the {\sf Ok} button.  This specifies that the dialog
will return with the `text_item <-selection' if the {\sf Ok} button
is pressed.  Add the constant @nil to the background using the popup
menu on the background.  This finishes the specification of our dialog
window.  The resulting behaviour model is shown in \figref{diaeditor3}.

\subsection{Generating source code}

\index{source code,from dialog editor}%
To generate source code, start PceEmacs using the {\sf Edit} command
from the background menu. This will open PceEmacs on the file {\tt
ask_name.pl}.  Any other PceEmacs window editing a Prolog source file
will do as well. Drag the {\tt ask_name} entry from the main window of
the Dialog Editor to the PceEmacs window. The window will indicate it is
ready to accept the Prolog source code. Now `drop' the code. The
source code will be inserted at the caret location. See
\figref{diaeditor4}.

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{diaeditor4}{Creating source-code}

\subsection{Linking the source code}

The generated source is a {\em description} of the dialog window.  This
description requires an interpreter to create the dialog window and use
it in an application.  This interpreter is implemented by make_dialog/2:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{make_dialog}{2}{?Reference, :Identifier}
Create a dialog window from a description generated by the Dialog
Editor. The predicate make_dialog/2 searches for a predicate dialog/2
and calls this using the given dialog {\em Identifier} to obtain a
description of the dialog window. See dialog/2 for the syntax of the
description.
    \predicate{dialog}{2}{?Identifier, ?Description}
Clause as generated by the dialog editor. The description is a list of
\mbox{<Name> {\tt :=} <Value>} pairs. It contains the following
elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{object}
Points to the Prolog variable defining the main object reference (the
first argument of make_dialog/2).
    \tick{parts}
A list of \mbox{<Var> {\tt :=} <NewTerm>}.  make_dialog/2 will simply
call new/2 on these terms to create the parts of the dialog window.
    \tick{modifications}
List of \mbox{<Var> {\tt :=} <ListOfModifications>} that have to be
applied to the parts to modify them from the default to the target
configuration. The <ListOfModifications> is a list of \mbox{<Attribute>
{\tt :=} <Value>}.
    \tick{layout}
List of \mbox{{\tt below(<Part1>, <Part2>)}} and \mbox{{\tt
right(<Part1>, <Part2>)}}, describing the symbolic layout of the dialog
window.
    \tick{behaviour}
List of \mbox{<Part> {\tt :=} <ListOfBehaviour>}, describing the
behaviour of the control element.  <ListOfBehaviour> is a list of
\mbox{<Attribute> {\tt :=} <Message>}, describing the \class{code}
objects associated with the controls.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

The wrapper program to make the dialog-description useful from an
application is given below.  First make_dialog/2 is used to create the
dialog.  Next the dialog is opened in the center of the display and
the system waits for the `frame ->return' message to be send.

\begin{code}
ask_name(Name) :-
	make_dialog(D, ask_name),
	get(D, confirm_centered, RawName),
	send(D, destroy),
	Name = RawName.
\end{code}


\subsection{Summary}

We have now completed the first guided tour through the Dialog Editor,
introducing the main concepts and the process of creating a dialog
window using this tool.  After creating a target dialog window, controls
are added to the dialog using drag-and-drop. Their attributes are edited
by double-clicking the new controls and filling the subsequently shown
dialog window. Next, the items are dragged roughly to the right
location, the editor is placed in layout mode and the {\sf layout}
button is used to let the Dialog Editor guess the symbolic layout
description. Next the behaviour is defined using the behaviour model
editor. Event-ports (control-attributes defining the callback of a
control) are linked to send-ports (send-method ports) and arguments are
linked to this activation relation. Finally the dialog window is dropped
in a PceEmacs window running in Prolog mode (the default when editing a
file with extension {\tt .pl} or {\tt .pro}). Finally, a small wrapper
must be defined that creates the dialog window from the description
using make_dialog/2 and opens the dialog in the proper way.


\section{Miscellaneous topics}

This section discusses various topics that were omitted from the Guided
Tour to keep it simple.

\subsection{Specifying callback to prolog}

Using the background popup of the behaviour editor, the object @prolog
(see \secref{pceprolog}) can be added to the model. Select {\sf Add Send
Port} to add a new predicate to the @prolog interface. Then type the
name of the predicate.  Now link the event-port of a control to the
predicate and link the arguments.

If the predicate is not defined, select `Edit' on menu of @prolog to
start PceEmacs on the source file. Now drag the predicate to the
PceEmacs window. This will insert the head of the predicate at the
caret. See \figref{diaprolog}

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{diaprolog}{Specifying Call-back to Prolog}


\subsection{Advanced example of behaviour}

\Figref{viewer} is the screen dump of an application and its behaviour
model of a tool that shows all files in a directory and clicking on a
file shows the file's contents in the editor to the left. It
demonstrates various aspects of advanced features for specifying
behaviour.

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{The text-field {\sf directory}}
Represented in the model by (1).  It is a normal \class{text_item}, but
the `text_item <->type' field is set to `directory'.  This implies the
<-selection of the text-item will return a \class{directory} object.
    \tick{Showing the files of the directory}
If the text-item is modified, a list of files in the directory should be
shown in the `file_list', a \class{list_browser}. The method
`list_browser ->members' may be used to fill the browser with a
collection of items.  This method expects a \class{chain} object.  The
get method `directory <-files' provides a chain holding the names of all
files in the directory.

Thus, the event-port `message' of the directory field must invoke the
send-port `members' of the file-list.  The argument should be the result
of applying <-files on the <-selection of the text-entry field. To
specify this, the get-port `selection' is {\em expanded} using the popup
menu of this port.  This operation adds (2) to the diagram.  The system
infers this expansion is an instance of class \class{directory} and
shows the most useful get-ports in its get-port menu. The `files'
get-port is added to (2) and linked to the activation relation between
`text_item ->message' and `list_browser ->members'.

To {\bf test} this part, put the Dialog editor in `run' mode, type the
name of a directory and {\sf ENTER} to activate the event-port.  If
anything goes wrong, the {\sf Simulate} option of the various popup
menus in the diagram may be used to test small parts of the model.
The {\em Documentation} option of these menus may be used to view the
relevant documentation from the online manual tools.
    \tick{Specifying the initial directory as a parameter}
Initialisation of the dialog is expressed by adding one or more {\em
init-ports} to the diagram using the background menu. In this particular
case, we would like to be able to pass a directory to start as a
parameter.  Hence, a {\em parameter-port} is added with the name `dir'.
First, the ->selection is set using the parameter and then the item is
->executed to activate its ->message.

Code generation will append the directory parameter to the identifier
of the dialog/2 clause.  In this case, this clause will start as:

\begin{code}
dialog(viewer(Dir),
       [ ...
       ]).
\end{code}

An instance is opened using the following calls:

\begin{code}
	...,
	make_dialog(D, viewer(StartDir)),
	send(D, open),
	...
\end{code}
    \tick{Showing a file}
The first step is to link the event-port `select_message' of the
file_list to the file_contents (3) \class{editor} object's send-port
`load'.  This method expects a file.  Due to the type conversion rules
of class \class{file}, the name of a file suffices, but the names from
file_list are relative to the directory object (2). First, the
<-selection of the file_list is expanded, resulting in (5), a
\class{dict_item} object.  The `dict_item <-key' contains the name
of the file.

The method `directory <-file' can be used to create a \class{file}
object from a name, that specifies an absolute path.  A get-port
`file' is added to (2) and this get-port is linked to the activation
relation.  This get operation requires the filename argument from (5).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specifying conditional actions}

\Figref{diacond} shows an example of a conditional activation relation.
A conditional relation is created making a connection from the fat dot
in the middle of an activation relation to a send-port. Success or
failure of the send-port will be interpreted as a condition on the
activation relation.

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{diacond}{Conditional activation}

\subsection{Load and save formats}

The Dialog Editor provides two load/save formats.  The {\sf Load},
{\sf Save}, {\sf Save As} and {\sf Save All} save and load the status
of the dialog editor as an XPCE object using `object ->save_in_file'.
This format loads quickly, but is rather vulnerable to future changes
in the Dialog Editor or any of the graphical classes.

Alternatively, the Dialog Editor can restore itself from the identifier
of a dialog/2 clause generated by itself or (slightly) modified.  In
this case, the layout of the behaviour model will be lost.

We advice to use Save/Load during application development.  If, during
the maintenance phase of your product it is necessary to modify a
dialog, either simply edit the dialog/2 clause, or load both the
application and the dialog editor and use {\sf Reload From Id} to
restart the Dialog Editor.

\section{Status and problems}

The current version of the Dialog Editor is experimental. It can be used
for serious application development as the output format is extensible,
so future extensions to the Dialog Editor will not break already
generated dialog windows.  The main problems identified are:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{Defining new controls}
It is desirable to be able to create new (compound) controls using the
dialog editor and save these in a library.  At the moment new controls
can only be created by programming them as a user-defined class.
Connecting these user-defined controls to the Dialog Editor is not
difficult, but no supported interface has been defined.
    \tick{Layout detection}
The layout detection often makes mistakes, partly because it does not
know about various important layout concepts.
    \tick{Integration with user-defined classes}
It is desirable to integrate the dialog editor in a neat way with
user-defined classes.  Notably, the editor should support activating and
defining methods on a user-defined refinement of the containing frame.
\end{itemize}
