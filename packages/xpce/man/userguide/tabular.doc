\section{Tabular layout}		\label{sec:tabular}

\product{} provides various mechanisms for two-dimensional layout.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [ Controller layout using `device->layout_dialog' ]
This method is used by the classes \class{dialog} and
\class{dialog_group}.  It knows about layout requirements in
controller windows, such as alignment of label- and value-width
in stacked controllers. etc.  Layout of controllers is described
in \chapref{controller}.

    \item [ Simple tabular layout using \class{format} ]
In instance of class \class{format} can be attached to a \class{device}
using `device->format'.  This causes the device to place its graphicals
according to the specification in the format object.  This technique is
frequently used to label images, place images in an image browser, etc.
See \secref{format}.

    \item [ Full table support using \class{table} ]
An instance of \class{table} can be associated with a \class{device} to
realise modern tables using the same primitives as defined in HTML-3:
row- and column spanning, alignment, spacing, rules and borders, etc.
The library \pllib{tabular} provides a user-friendly front-end for
most of the functionality of class \class{table}.
\end{itemlist}


\subsection{Using \class{format}}		\label{sec:format}

Class \class{format} can be seen as a poor-mens version of
\class{table}. On the other hand, there are two cases that still make it
a valuable solution. One is to deal with simple compound graphicals,
such as a bitmap with a label displayed below it. The other is for
browsing collections of graphical objects such as images.

The class \class{icon} below displays a label-text below an image.

\begin{pcecode}
:- pce_begin_class(icon, device).

:- pce_global(@icon_format, make_icon_format).

make_icon_format(F) :-
	new(F, format(horizontal, 1, @on)),
	send(F, adjustment, vector(center)),
	send(F, row_sep, 2).

initialise(Icon, Img:image, Label:name) :->
	send_super(Icon, initialise),
	send(Icon, format, @icon_format),
	send(Icon, display, bitmap(Img)),
	send(Icon, display, text(Label, center)). 

:- pce_end_class.
\end{pcecode}

An example using \class{format} for distribution graphicals over a
window is the library \pllib{pce_image_browser}.


\subsection{Using \class{table} using the ``tabular'' library}

\index{layout,manager}%
The class \class{table} acts much the same way as class \class{format}
in the sence that it is attached to a \class{device} and modifies the
layout management of this device.  For this purpose it uses an interface
defined in \product{} version 5.0 and realised using the methods
`device<->layout_manager' and `graphical<->layout_interface'.
\Figref{layoutmgr} gives an overview of the classes realising
tabular layout.

\postscriptfig[width=\linewidth]{layoutmgr}{Layout manager interface for
tables}

The advantage of the approach using layout manager objects is that they
can easily be associated with any subclass of \class{device}, such as
a \class{window}.  The disadvantage is that the communication gets more
difficult due to the different objects involved.  This complication is
hidden in the \productpl{} class \class{tabular}, a subclass of
\class{device} with an associated \class{table} and methods for
guiding the messages for common usage.

\begin{description}
    \sendmethod{tabular}{initialise}{}
Create a device with associated table.

    \sendmethod{tabular}{append}{%
       Label:name{\tt |}graphical,
       Font:[font],
       HAlign:[\{left,center,right\}],
       Valign[\{top,center,bottom\}],
       Colspan:[1..],
       Rowspan:[1..],
       Background:[colour],
       Colour:[colour]}
Append a new cell. Cells are places left-to-right.  The arguments are:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item[\arg{Label}]
Defines the content. It this is a \class{name}, a \class{text} is created.
Otherwise the graphical is immediately placed in the table.  

    \item[\arg{Font}]
Defines the \class{font} if a \class{text} is created from a
\arg{Label} of type \class{name}.

    \item[\arg{HAlign}]
Horizontal alignment.  When omitted, the value from the corresponding
\class{table_column} is used.

    \item[\arg{VAlign}]
Vertical alignment. When omitted, the value from the corresponding
\class{table_row} is used.

    \item[\arg{Colspan}]
Number of columns spanned.  Default is 1.

    \item[\arg{Rowspan}]
Number of rows spanned.  Default is 1.

    \item[\arg{Background}]
Colour or pattern used to fill the background of the cell.  When
omitted, the value from row or column is used or the background is
left untouched.

    \item[\arg{Colour}]
Defines the default foreground colour when painting the cell's
graphical.  When omitted, the row, column and finally device are
tried.
\end{itemlist}

    \sendmethod{tabular}{append_label_button}{Field:name}
This method appends a button that is nicely aligned with the cell. If
the button is depressed it activates ->sort_rows, providing the column
index and the row below the row holding the button.

    \sendmethod{tabular}{sort_rows}{Col:int, Row:int}
A virtual method with a body that prints an informative message.  It
is called from a button installed using ->append_label_button and
receives the column to sort-on as well as the first row to sort.

    \getmethod{tabular}{table}{}{Table}
Returns the \class{table} serving as <-layout_manager.

    \sendmethod{tabular}{table_width}{Width:int}
Force the table to perform the layout in the indicated width.  Initially
the width of a \class{tabular} is defined by the content.  Setting the
width forces the \class{table} to negotiate with its columns and then
force the width of the columns.

    \sendmethod{tabular}{event}{Event:event}
This refinement of `device->event' determines the cell in which the
event occurs.  If this cell has a `cell<->note_mark' attached and the
graphical defines the method ->on_mark_clicked, the event is checked
against the mark-image. Otherwise the event is forwarded to the
graphical inside the cell, even it it doesn't occur in the area of
the graphical, making small (text-)objects sensitive to all events in
the cell. Finally, this method checks for attempts to drag the
column-borders, changing the layout of the table.
\end{description}

As \class{tabular} \jargon{delegates} all messages not understood to
the <-table, the messages of this class are also available.  Below are
the most important ones.

\begin{description}
    \sendmethod{table}{next_row}{EndGroup:[bool]}
Start the next row in the table. If \arg{EndGroup} is @on, the
just-finished row is marked to end a row-group.  See also ->rules.

    \sendmethod{table}{border}{Border:0..}
Defines the thickness of border and rule-lines.  Default is 0, not
drawing any lines.

    \sendmethod{table}{frame}{\{void,above,below,hsides,vsides,box\}}
Defines which parts of the box around the table are painted (if <-border
$> 0$).  The terminology is from HTML-3.

    \sendmethod{table}{rules}{\{none,groups,rows,cols,all\}}
Defines which lines between rows/columns are painted (if <-border
$> 0$).  The terminology is from HTML-3.

    \sendmethod{table}{cell_padding}{Padding:int{\tt|}size}
Defines the space around the content of a cell.  If this is an integer
this space is the same in horizontal and vertical directions.  If it
is a \class{size} these can be specified independently.

    \sendmethod{table}{cell_spacing}{Spacing:int{\tt|}size}
Defines the distance between the cells. Same rules as for ->cell_padding
applies.  In some cases pretty effects can be achieved settin this value
to minus the <-border.
\end{description}

Below we build a small example.

\begin{pcecode}
:- use_module(library(tabular)).
:- use_module(library(autowin)).

make_table :-
	new(P, auto_sized_picture('Table with merged cells')), 
	send(P, display, new(T, tabular)),
	send(T, border, 1),
	send(T, cell_spacing, -1),
	send(T, rules, all),
	send_list(T,
		  [ append(new(graphical), rowspan := 2),
		    append('Length/mm', bold, center, colspan := 3),
		    next_row,
		    append('body', bold, center),
		    append('tail', bold, center),
		    append('ears', bold, center),
		    next_row,
		    append('males', bold),
		    append('31.4'),
		    append('23.7'),
		    append('3.8'),
		    next_row,
		    append('females', bold),
		    append('29.6'),
		    append('20.8'),
		    append('3.4')
		  ]),
	send(P, open).
\end{pcecode}
