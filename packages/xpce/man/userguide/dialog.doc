\chapter{Dialog (controller) windows}		\label{sec:controller}

\index{controllers}%
\product{} Dialog windows are normally used to display a number of
controllers, named \class{dialog_item}{\em s} in \product{}'s jargon. Class
\class{dialog} is a subclass of \class{window} with specialised methods
for positioning controllers. Dialog items are graphical objects
specialised for displaying and/or editing particular data.
\Figref{dialoghierarchy} illustrates the inheritance relations relevant
to dialog windows and the locations of the most important methods.

\postscriptfig[width=4in]{dialoghierarchy}{Dialog Inheritance Hierarchy}

Dialogs can be created both by using the new/2 and send/[2-12]
operations as well as by using the Dialog Editor which is described in
\appref{dialogeditor}. This section describes the first mechanism.
Reading this chapter will help you understanding the dialog editor.


\section{An example}

Before diving into the complexities we will illustrate normal usage
through an example.  The following Prolog predicate creates a dialog
for entering information on an employee. The result, running on
Windows-NT, is shown in \figref{employee}.

\begin{pcecode}
ask_employee :-
	new(Dialog, dialog('Define employee')),
	send_list(Dialog, append, 
		  [ new(N1, text_item(first_name)),
		    new(N2, text_item(family_name)),
		    new(S,  new(S, menu(sex))),
		    new(A,  int_item(age, low := 18, high := 65)),
		    new(D,  menu(department, cycle)),
		    button(cancel, message(Dialog, destroy)),
		    button(enter, and(message(@prolog,
					      assert_employee,
					      N1?selection,
					      N2?selection,
					      S?selection,
					      A?selection,
					      D?selection),
				      message(Dialog, destroy)))
		  ]),
	send_list(S, append, [male, female]),
	send_list(D, append, [research, development, marketing]),
	send(Dialog, default_button, enter),
	send(Dialog, open).

assert_employee(FirstName, FamilyName, Sex, Age, Depth) :-
	format('Adding ~w ~w ~w, age ~w, working at ~w~n',
	       [ Sex, FirstName, FamilyName, Age, Depth]).
\end{pcecode}

This example shows the layout capabilities of \class{dialog} and
its \class{dialog_item} objects.  Simply appending items will place
items vertically and group buttons in rows.  Labels are properly
aligned.  The {\sf enter} button defines a call-back on the
predicate assert_employee/5 using the values from the various
controllers.  \Secref{exeobjects} explains the use of \class{message}
objects in detail.

\section{Built-in dialog items}

\index{controllers,built-in}\index{dialog_item,built-in types}%
\Tabref{diaitems} provides an overview of the built-in dialog items.
The \productpl{} library defines various additional items as Prolog
classes.  See the file Overview in the library directory.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularlp}{\class{dialog_group}}
\hline
\class{button}		& Simple \idx{push-button}.  Executes <-message
			  when pressed. \\
\hline
\class{text_item}	& A \idx{text-entry field}.  Editable or
			  non-editable, built-in type conversion (for example
			  to enter a numerical value), completion using
			  the space-bar if a value-set is provided. \\
\hline
\class{int_item}	& Like a \class{text_item}, but providing properly
			  sized field, buttons for one-up/down, type- and
			  range-checking. \\
\hline
\class{slider}		& Select numerical value in a range.  Handles
			  both integers and floating point values. \\
\hline
\class{menu}		& Implements various styles of menus with different
			  visual feedback.  Realises \idx{radio-button},
			  \idx{tick-box}, \idx{combo-box} and much more. \\
\hline
\class{menu_bar}	& Row of pulldown (\class{popup}) menus.
			  Normally displayed in a small dialog above
			  the other windows in the frame. \\
\hline
\class{label}		& Image or textual label.  Normally not
			  sensitive to user actions. \\
\hline
\class{list_browser}	& Shows a list of items.  List-browsers have been
			  designed to handle lists with many items. Class
			  \class{browser} is a window-based version. \\
\hline
\class{editor}		& Powerful text-editor.  Handles multiple and
			  proportional fonts, text-attributes, fragment 
			  marking, etc.  Class \class{view} is a window
			  based version. \\
\hline
\class{tab}		& Tagged sub-dialog, that may be combined with
			  other \classs{tab} into a \class{tab_stack},
			  realising a tabbed controller-window.  Often
			  seen in modern applications to deal with many
			  setting options. \\
\class{tab_stack}	& Stack of \class{tab} objects. \\
\class{dialog_group}	& Group of dialog items, possible with border
			  and label. \\
\hline
\end{tabularlp}
\end{center}

\section{Layout in dialog windows}

\index{layout, in dialog}\index{dialog,layout in}%
The layout inside a dialog window may be specified by two means, either
using pixel-coordinates or using symbolic layout descriptions. The
latter is strongly encouraged, both because it is generally much easier
and because the layout will work properly if the end-user uses different
preferences (see \chapref{classvar}) than the application developer.

The following methods can be used to define the layout of a dialog. All
methods actually have both send- and get-versions. The methods listed
only as `->send' methods are unlikely to be used as get-methods in
application code.

\begin{description}
    \sendmethod{dialog_item}{above}{dialog_item}%
    \sendmethod*{dialog_item}{below}{dialog_item}%
    \sendmethod*{dialog_item}{left}{dialog_item}%
    \sendmethod*{dialog_item}{rigth}{dialog_item}%
These relations built a two-dimensional grid of dialog-items and
determine the relative positioning of the dialog items.  It suffices
to relate each dialog item to one other item.
    \sendmethod{device}{append_dialog_item}{graphical, [\{below,right,next_row\}]}
    \sendmethod*{dialog}{append}{graphical, [\{below,right,next_row\}]}
Append a dialog item relative to the last one appended. This method is
the principal methods used to fill dialog windows. For the first item,
the last argument is ignored. If the last argument is {\tt below}, this
item is placed below the previous one. If the argument is {\tt right},
it is placed right of the previous one and if the argument is {\tt
next_row}, the item is placed below the first one of the current row of
dialog items. If the last argument is @default, dialog objects are
placed {\tt next_row}, except for buttons, which are placed in rows,
left to right.
    \sendmethod{dialog}{gap}{size}
Defines the distance between rows and columns of items as well as the
distance between the bounding box of all items and the window border.
    \bothmethod{dialog_item}{reference}{point}
Point relative to the top-left corner that defines the {\em
reference-point} of the dialog item.  If two items are aligned
horizontally or vertically, it are actually their reference
points that are aligned.
    \sendmethod{dialog_item}{alignment}{\{column,left,center,right\}}
This attribute controls how items are aligned left-to-right in their
row. An item with ->alignment: {\tt column} will be alignment horizontally
using the references of its upper or lower neighbour.  Horizontally
adjacent items with the same alignment will be flushed left, centered
or flushed right if the alignment is one of {\tt left}, {\tt center}
or {\tt right}.  The alignment value is normally specified as a class-variable
and used to determine the layout of rows of \class{button} objects.
    \sendmethod{dialog_item}{hor_stretch}{}{0..100}
After completing the initial layout, possibly remaining horizontal space
is distributed proportionally over items that return a non-zero value for
this attribute.  By default, class \class{text_item} yields 100 for this
value, normally extending text_items as far as possible to the right.
\end{description}

\noindent The methods above deal with the placement of items relative to
each other. The methods below ensure that columns of items have properly
aligned labels and values.

\begin{description}
    \bothmethod{dialog_item}{label_width}{[0..]}
If the item has a visible label, the label_width is the width of the box
in which the label is printed. The dialog layout mechanism will align
the labels of items that are placed above each other if
<-auto_label_align is @on. The argument @default assigns the minimum
width of the label, the width required by the text of the label.
    \bothmethod{dialog_item}{label_format}{\{left,center,right\}}
Determines how the label is aligned in its box.  The values are
{\tt left}, {\tt center} and {\tt right}.  This value is normally
defined by the look and feel.
    \bothmethod{dialog_item}{value_width}{[0..]}
If the item displays multiple values left-to-right (only class
\class{menu} at the moment), `dialog_item ->value_width' is used to
negotiate equal width of the value-boxes similar to ->label_width if
<-auto_value_align is @on.
\end{description}

\noindent
The methods listed below activate the layout mechanism.  Normally,
only `device ->layout_dialog' needs to be called by the user.

\begin{description}
    \sendmethod{dialog}{layout}{[size]}
    \sendmethod*{device}{layout_dialog}{gap=[size], size=[size], border=[size]}
Implements the dialog layout mechanism. `Dialog->layout' simply calls
`device ->layout_dialog' using `dialog <-gap'. `Device->layout_dialog'
first uses the <-above, etc.\ attributes to build a two-dimensional
array of items. Next, it will align the labels and value of items placed
in the same column. Then it will determine the size and reference point
for each of the items and determine the cell-size. It will then align
all items vertically and afterwards horizontally, while considering the
`dialog_item <-alignment'.
    \sendmethod{dialog}{_compute_desired_size}{}
Sent from `frame ->fit' to each of the member windows.  For class
\class{dialog}, this activates ->layout and then computes the
desired size of the window.
\end{description}


\subsection{Practical usage and problems}

Most of the above methods are only used rarely for fine-tuning the
layout.  Almost all dialog windows used in the development environment,
demo applications and Prolog library simply use `dialog ->append',
sometimes specifying the last argument.  

Two problems are currently not taken care of very well.  Aligning
multiple objects with a single third object can only be achieved
using a sub-dialog in the form of a device and often requires some
additional messages.  The dialog of \figref{layoutdemo1} is created using the
following code:

\begin{pcecode}
layoutdemo1 :-
	new(D, dialog('Layout Demo 1')),
	send(D, append,
	     new(BTS, dialog_group(buttons, group))),
	send(BTS, gap, size(0, 30)),
	send(BTS, append, button(add)),
	send(BTS, append, button(rename), below),
	send(BTS, append, button(delete), below),
	send(BTS, layout_dialog),
	send(D, append, new(LB, list_browser), right),
	send(D, append, new(TI, text_item(name, ''))),
	send(LB, alignment, left),
	send(D, layout),
	send(LB, bottom_side, BTS?bottom_side),
	send(LB, right_side, TI?right_side),
	send(D, open).
\end{pcecode}

\postscriptfig{layoutdemo1}{Aligning multiple items}

In line~3, a \class{device} is added to the dialog to contain the
stack of buttons.  This device is sent an explicit ->layout_dialog
to position the buttons.  Next, the list_browser is placed to the
right of this stack and the text_item on the next row.

If you try this layout, the first column will hold the device and the
text_item and the list_browser will be placed right of this column and
thus right of the text_item.  Using `dialog_item ->aligment: left'
enforces the list_browser to flush left towards the device.  Now we
enforce the layout and adjust the bottom and right sides of the
list_browser to the device and text_item.

\index{dialog,resizing}%
Dialog windows do not reposition their contents if the window is resized
in the current implementation.  If the window is enlarged, the items stay
in the top-left corner.  If the window is made smaller, part of the items
may become invisible.  Resizing can be implemented by the user by
trapping the `window ->resize_message'.


\section{Modal dialogs: prompting for answers}	\label{sec:modal}

\index{modal,dialog}\index{ask questions}\index{prompt}%
A {\em modal} dialog is a dialog that is displayed and blocks the
application until the user has finished answering the questions posed
in the dialog.  Modal dialogs are often used to prompt for values
needed to create a new entity in the application or for changing
settings.

Modal windows are implemented using the methods `frame <-confirm' and
`frame ->return'. `Frame <-confirm' invokes `frame ->open' if the frame
is not visible and then starts reading events and processing them.
`Frame ->return: value' causes `frame <-confirm' to return with the
value passed as argumen to ->return. The following code is a very simple
example opening a dialog and waiting for the user to enter a name and
press {\sc return} or the {\sf Ok} button.

\begin{code}
ask_name(Name) :-
	new(D, dialog('Prompting for name')),
	send(D, append,
	     new(TI, text_item(name, ''))),
	send(D, append,
	     button(ok, message(D, return,
				TI?selection))),
	send(D, append,
	     button(cancel, message(D, return, @nil))),
	send(D, default_button, ok), % Ok: default button
	get(D, confirm, Answer),     % This blocks!
	send(D, destroy),
	Answer \== @nil,	     % canceled
	Name = Answer.

?- ask_name(X).

X = 'Bob Worker'
\end{code}

See also \secref{application} for a discussion on how frames may be
related, as well as alternatives for keeping control in Prolog.


\subsection{Example: a simple editor for multiple fonts}

The following example  allows the user to select text in an editor
and change its appearance. The application is shown in \figref{wysiwyg}.

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{wysiwyg}{Very simple WYSIWYG editor}

\hr
\input{wysiwyg.tex}

\section{Editing attributes}

\index{attribute,editing}%
In the previous section, we discussed dialogs for entering values.
Another typical use of dialog windows is to modify setting of the
application, or more in general, edit attributes of existing entities
in the application.  These entities may both be represented as \product{}
objects or as constructs in the host language (dynamic predicates
or the recorded database in Prolog).

Such dialog windows first show the current settings.  It allows for
modifying the controls showing the various aspects of the current
state and three buttons providing the following functions:

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{\sf Apply}
Apply the current controls, which implies invoking some behaviour
on the application to realise the setting of the---modified--- controls.
    \tick{\sf Restore}
Reset the controls to the current status of the application.
    \tick{\sf Cancel}
Destroy the dialog and do not modify the current settings of the
application.
\end{itemize}

The following methods are defined on all primitive controls as well
as on the dialog window faciliate the implementations of dialog windows
as described above.

\begin{description}
    \sendmethod{dialog_item}{default}{any$|$function}
    \sendmethod*{dialog_item}{restore}{}
For most dialog items, the <->default value is the second initialisation
argument. Instead of a plain value, this can be a \class{function}
object.  The initial <-selection is set by evaluating this function.  In
addition, ->restore will evaluate the function again and reset the
selection.
    \sendmethod{dialog_item}{apply}{always:bool}
Execute the ->message of each dialog item for which `dialog_item
<-modified' yields @on.  If the argument is @on, the modified flag
is not checked.
    \sendmethod{dialog}{apply}{}
    \sendmethod*{dialog}{restore}{}
Broadcasts ->apply or ->restore to each item in the dialog.
\end{description}

\subsection{Example: editing attributes of a graphical}

We will illustrate these methods described above in this example, which
implements a dialog for editing the colour of the interior and thickness
of the line around a graphical. Double-clicking on a graphical pops up a
dialog window for changing these values. The result is show in
\figref{editgraphical}.

\begin{pcecode}
colour(white).
colour(red).
colour(green).
colour(blue).
colour(black).

append_colour(M, C) :-
	new(Img, pixmap(@nil, white, black, 32, 16)),
	send(Img, fill, colour(C)),
	send(M, append, menu_item(colour(C), label := Img)).

edit_graphical(Gr) :-
	new(D, dialog(string('Edit graphical %s', Gr?name))),
	send(D, append,
	     new(M, menu(colour, choice,
			 message(Gr, fill_pattern, @arg1)))),
	send(M, layout, horizontal),
	forall(colour(C), append_colour(M, C)),
	send(M, default, Gr?fill_pattern),
	send(D, append, slider(pen, 0, 10, Gr?pen,
			       message(Gr, pen, @arg1))),
	send(D, append, button(apply)),
	send(D, append, button(restore)),
	send(D, append, button(quit, message(D, destroy))),
	send(D, default_button, apply),
	send(D, open).

attributedemo :-
	send(new(P, picture('Attribute Demo')), open),
	send(P, display,
	     new(B, box(100, 100)), point(20, 20)),
	send(P, display,
	     new(E, ellipse(100, 50)), point(150, 20)),
	send_list([B, E], fill_pattern, colour(white)),
	new(C, click_gesture(left, '', double,
			     message(@prolog, edit_graphical,
				     @receiver))),
	send(B, recogniser, C),
	send(E, recogniser, C).
\end{pcecode}
