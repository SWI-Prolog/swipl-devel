\chapter{Commonly encountered problems}

In this chapter we list a number of commonly encountered problems
in using PCE/Prolog.  

\newcommand{\problem}[1]{\tick{#1}}

\begin{description}
    \problem{Failed to start manpce/0}
There are various common causes for this problem.  The first is that PCE
failed to open the display.  This problem is described below.  Another
possibility is that PCE cannot find its library or the help files.  You
may verify the existence of the manual libraries by typing
\begin{code}
1 ?- [library('man/v_class')].
/usr/local/lib/xpce/prolog/lib/man/v_class.pl compiled
into man_class, 0.15 sec, 11,644 bytes.
\end{code}
If the manual appears, but the descriptions are empty PCE probably
cannot find the help files.  These should be in $<$Home$>$/man/reference,
where $<$Home$>$ is the result of \line{1 ?- get(@pce, home, Home).}  Check
the existence and permissions of this directory and its member-files.

Finally, PCE might not be able to read it's resource files.  The PCE
resource file should be installed as \file{/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Pce}.
Check its existence and access rights.  If you have no permission to
create this file, you may copy <Home>/Pce to your home-directory.

    \problem{Cannot open display}
PCE tries to open the display from the address specified by the DISPLAY
environment variable.  It ignores the `--display' command line option.  The
display might also be specified explicitly using `display <->address'.
PCE will open the display as soon as it needs X-resource values or it
needs graphical operations.  This will fail if the specified address is
not legal, there is no X-server at that address or the X-server denies
the access.  Examine the error message carefully.  Make sure X-windows
is running at the specified address.  Make sure you have access to this
server.  See \idx{xauth} (when running \idx{MIT_MAGIC_COOKIE}) and \idx
{xhost}.  If PCE still complains, validate the access rights by starting
a normal X-application (e.g.\ xterm) in the same context.  Always restart
PCE after a fatal or system error as the system might be corrupted.

    \problem{Failed to convert resource value}
This implies PCE could not translate a default specified in
\file{~/.Xdefaults}, \file{/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Pce} or the PCE
class resource specification (see `resource <-default') into a PCE
object of the type of the resource.  PCE will first try the class
defined default value and generate a fatal error if this fails as well.
Try to locate the resource that causes the trouble and where it is
defined.

    \problem{Bad integer reference}
This is a PCE/Prolog interface warning.  It implies the integer
object reference given to send/[2-12], etc.\ is not valid.  The most
common reason is that the object has already be freed, either explicitly
or by PCE's incremental garbage collector.  See section~\ref{sec:memory}.

    \problem{Unknown class}
Attempt to create an instance of a non-existing class.  Apart from the
common mistakes like mistyped class-names, etc.\ this might be caused by
1) giving a list argument to a send- or get- operation (class `.')
or 2) trying to pass a term through send/[2-12] or get/[3-13].  See
section~\ref {sec:notprolog}.   

    \problem{Illegal PCE object description}
This implies a non-translatable Prolog datum was passed to the interface.
Normally this will be a non-ground%
    \footnote{A `ground' term is a Prolog term that has no
	      unbound variables.}
argument to new/2, send/[2-12] or get/[3-13].
