\chapter{Getting started}		\label{sec:starting}

This section introduces programming the \productpl{} environment: the
entities (objects), referencing objects and manipulating objects.  Most
of the material is introduced with examples.  A complete definition of
the interface primitives is given in \appref{interface}.

\section{Starting \productpl{}}

\begin{xpceonly}
\product{} can be connected to several Prolog implementations.  It is a
normal Unix executable and is started from the Unix shell like
any other program.  When \productpl{} starts, it appears just like
the Prolog system it is based on, except for the banner message.
Below we started \product{}/SWI-Prolog.

\index{version}%
SWI-Prolog's prompt is ``<n> ?-'' where <n> is the
history-number of the command. The banner indicates the \product{} version.
The indicated version is 5.1 and the patch-level is 0.
\end{xpceonly}

\begin{pwonly}
\product{} is distributed as a \quintus{} library package, called
\file{prowindows3.1}.  This implies it may be loaded on top of the
running \quintus{} Prolog system using:

\begin{code}
| ?- [library(pce)].
% loading file /usr/local/quintus/prowindows3.1/library/pce.qof
...
\end{code}

Regarding the size and loading time of \product{}, a seperate executable
named \program{pw3} is created that contains the \product{} kernel, and
basic development and debugging libraries.  This is the executable that
is normally used for interactive development and debugging.

\section{Prolog ... and what?}

This section describes the four basic Prolog predicates used to
control \product{} from Prolog.  These four predicates map onto the basic
functions of \product{}'s virtual machine: creating, destroying,
manipulating and querying {\em objects}, the basic entities of
\product{}.

For those not familiar with this jargon, an object is an entity with a
state and associated procedures, called {\em methods}. Objects may
represent just about anything. In \product{}'s world there are objects
representing a position in a two-dimensional plane as well as an entire
window on your screen. Each object belongs to a {\em class}. The class
defines the constituents of the state as well as the procedures
associated with the object. For example, a position in a two-dimensional
plane is represented by an object of class \class{point}. The state of
a point object consists of its X- and Y-coordinates. A point has methods
to set the X- and Y-coordinate, mirror the point over a reference point,
compute its distance to another point, etc.

\subsection{Creating objects: new}			\label{sec:new2}

\index{object,reference}\index{reference, object}
The predicate new/2 (new(?Reference,~+NewTerm)) {\em creates} an
object in the \product{} world and either assigns the given {\em reference}
to it or unifies the first argument with a \product{} generated reference.
An (object-) reference is a unique handle used in further
communication with the object.  Below are some examples (\verb$?-$ is
the Prolog prompt):

\begin{code}
1 ?- new(P, point(10,20)).
P = @772024

2 ?- new(@demo, dialog('Demo Window')).
\end{code}

The first example creates an instance of class point from the
arguments `10' and `20'.  The reference is represented in Prolog using
the prefix operator \functor{@}{1}.  For \product{} generated references
the argument of this term is a \product{} generated integer value.  These
integers are guaranteed to be unique.  The second example creates a
dialog object.  A dialog is a window that is specialised for
displaying controllers such as buttons, text-entry-fields,
etc.  In this example we have specified the reference.  Such a
reference must be of the form @Atom. \product{} will associate the created
object with this reference.%
    \footnote{Normal applications use almost exclusively \product{} generated
	      references.  Many of the examples in this manual are
	      typed from the terminal and Prolog specified references
	      are easier to type.}

As illustrated by the examples above, the second argument to new/2 is a
term. The principal functor denotes the name of the class of which an
instance is created and the arguments are the initialisation parameters.
The complete transformation rules are given in
\appref{interface}.

As stated before, an object has a state. At creation time, the initial
state is defined by the class from which the object is created and the
initialisation arguments. In our example, the point is assigned an
x-value of 10 and and y-value of 20. The dialog is assigned the label
`Demo Window'. A dialog window has many {\em slots}%
    \footnote{The attributes of an object state are called slots. In
	      other languages they may be called {\em instance
	      variables} or fields.}
The example defines the `label'. All the other slots are set to
the default value described in the class definition. 


\subsection{Modifying object state: send}

The state of an object may be manipulated using the predicate
send/2 (send(+Receiver, +Selector(...Args...))).  The first 
argument of this predicate is an object reference.  The second
is a term.  The principal functor of which is the name of the
method to invoke ({\em selector}) and the arguments are arguments
to the operation.
    
\begin{code}
3 ?- send(@772024, x(15)).
4 ?- send(@demo, append(text_item(name))).
\end{code}

The first example invokes the {\em method} `x' of the point object. It
sets the instance variable x of the corresponding point object to the
argument value. The second example invokes the method `append' of class
dialog. This method appends a UI component to the dialog window. The
component is specified by the term `text_item(name)', which is converted
into an object just as the second argument of new/2. The query below
opens the dialog window.

\begin{code}
5 ?- send(@demo, open).
\end{code}

If everything is ok, a window as shown in \figref{dialog}
appears on your screen. The border (in the figure this is the title-bar
displayed above the window) is determined by the window manager you are
using. It should look the same as any other window on your terminal. If
an error of any kind appears, please refer to
\appref{trouble}.


\postscriptfig{dialog}{Example Dialog Window}

\subsection{Querying objects: get}

The next fundamental interface predicate is get/3. It is used to obtain
information on the state of objects. The first two arguments are the
same as for send/2. The last argument is unified with the return-value.
The return value is normally an object reference, except for \product{}
\class{name} objects, that are returned as a Prolog \idx{atom},
\product{} integers (\idx{int}) that are translated to Prolog integers
and \product{} \class{real} objects, that are translated to Prolog
\idx{floating point} numbers. Examples:

\begin{code}
6 ?- get(@772024, y, Y).
Y = 20
7 ?- get(@demo, display, D).
D = @display/display
8 ?- get(@772024, distance(point(100,100)), Distance).
Distance = 117
\end{code}

The first example just obtains the value of the `y' instance variable.
The second example returns the display object on which @demo is
displayed.  This is the reference to an object of class display that
represents your screen.%
    \footnote{Prolog would normally print `@display'.  The
    	      \pllib{pce_portray} defines a clause for the Prolog
	      predicate portray/1 that prints object references as
	      `@Reference/Class'. This library is used throughout all
	      the examples of this manual.}
The last example again shows the creation of objects from the
arguments to send/2 and get/3 and also shows that the
returned value does not need to be a direct instance variable of the
object.  The return value is an integer representing the (rounded)
distance between @772024 and point(100,100).

The second example illustrates that get/3 returns objects by
their reference.  This reference may be used for further queries.
The example below computes the width and height of your screen.

\begin{code}
9 ?- get(@display, size, Size),
     get(Size, width, W),
     get(Size, height, H).
Size = @4653322, W = 1152, H = 900
\end{code}

As a final example, type something in the text entry field and try
the following:

\begin{code}
10 ?- get(@demo, member(name), TextItem),
      get(TextItem, selection, Text).
TextItem = @573481/text_item, Text = hello
\end{code}

\index{graphical,finding}\index{finding,graphical}
The first get operation requests a member of the dialog with the given
name (`name').  This will return the object reference of the text_item
object appended to the dialog.  The next request obtains the
`selection' of the text_item.  This is the text typed in by the user.


\subsection{Removing objects: free}

\index{remove,objects}\index{object,remove}
The final principal interface predicate is free/1.  Its argument is
an object reference as returned by new/2 or get/3.  It will remove
the object from the \product{} object base.  Examples:

\begin{code}
12 ?- free(@772024).
13 ?- free(@demo).
14 ?- free(@display).
No
\end{code}

The second example not only removed the dialog window object from
the \product{} object base, it also removes the associated X-window from
the screen.  The last example illustrates that certain system objects
have been protected against freeing.


\section{Optional arguments}

\index{default arguments}\index{optional arguments}\index{argument,optional}%
Arguments to \product{} methods are identified by their position.  Many
methods have both obligatory and optional arguments.  If obligatory
arguments are omitted \product{} will generate a warning.  If optional
arguments are omitted \product{} will fill the argument with the constant
@default.  The interpretation of @default is left to the
implementation of the receiving method.  See also \chapref{online}.

\section{Named arguments}			\label{sec:namedargs}

\index{argument,named}\index{named argument} Some methods take a lot of
arguments of which you generally only want to specify a few. A good
example is the creation of a \class{style} object. A style is an object
used to control the attributes of displayed text: font, fore- and
background colour, underline, etc. Its ->initialise method, serving the
same role the {\em \idx{constructor}} in \idx{C++}, takes 7 arguments.
Both calls below create a style object representing an underlined
text-fragment:

\begin{code}
1 ?- new(X, style(@default, @default, @default, @default, @on)).
2 ?- new(X, style(underline := @on)).
\end{code}

The names of arguments are specified in the reference manual. For
example, the method `area ->set', used to set one or more of the X-, Y-,
H- and W-attributes of a rectangle, has the specification given below.
For each argument that is specified as @default, the corresponding slot
will not be changed.

\begin{code}
area->set: x=[int], y=[int], width=[int], height=[int]
\end{code}

The following example illustrates the usage of this method:

\begin{code}
1 ?- new(A, area),
     send(A, set(y := 10, height := 50)).
\end{code}


\section{Argument conversion}

\index{arguments,typed}\index{type}\index{type,conversion}
Arguments to \product{} methods are {\em typed} and variables are dynamically
typed.  This combination is used for two purposes: automatic conversion
and raising exceptions at the earliest possible point if conversion
is not defined.

For example, the send-method `colour' on class \class{graphical}
specifies accepts a single argument of type `colour'. A colour in \product{}
is represented by a colour {\em object}. Colour objects may be created
from their name. The natural way to specify a box should be coloured
`red' is:

\begin{code}
...,
send(Box, colour(colour(red))),
...
\end{code}

Because the ->colour method knows that it expects an instance of class
colour, and because class colour defines the conversion from a name to a
colour (see \secref{omsmethods}), the following message achieves the
same goal:

\begin{code}
...,
send(Box, colour(red)),
...
\end{code}

Some other examples of classes defining type conversion are
\class{font}, \class{image}, \class{name}, \class{string}, \class{real}
and the non-object data item {\em int}. The following messages are
thus valid:

\begin{code}
...,
send(Box, x('10')),		% atom --> int
send(Box, selected(true)),	% atom --> boolean
send(Text, font(bold)),		% atom --> font
send(Text, string(10)),		% int  --> string
...
\end{code}


\section{Send and get with more arguments}	\label{sec:sendmanyargs}

Though the principal predicates for invoking behaviour are send/2 and
get/3, \product{} provides an alternative using send/[2-12] and
get/[3-13].  The following goals are all identical.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt send(Box, width(100)) &
\tt send(Box, width, 100) \\
\tt get(Point, distance(point(10,10), D) &
\tt get(Point, distance, point(10,1), D) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This alternative is provided for compatibility to pre-5.0 versions as
well as to support users that dislike the new-style send/2 and get/3. It
is realised using goal_expansion/2 and thus poses only a small
compile-time overhead.


\section{Notation}

\index{notation,in this manual}
This manual, as well as all other \product{} documentation both printed and
online uses some notational conventions.  Instead of speaking of
`the send-method colour of class box', we write

\begin{quote}
`box ->colour'
\end{quote}

\noindent
Similar, instead of `the get-method height of class window', we
write

\begin{quote}
`window <-height'
\end{quote}

\noindent
In some cases, the arguments and/or the return type of the
method are specified:

\begin{quote}
`box ->colour: colour'
`window <-height ==>int'
\end{quote}


\section{Example: show files in directory}	\label{sec:fileviewer}

In this section we illustrate the above with some simple examples.
We also show how the GUI can call procedures in the Prolog system.

The demo creates a list of files from a given directory and allows
the user to view a file.  \Figref{fileviewer} shows the result.

\postscriptfig[width=\textwidth]{fileviewer}{The FileViewer demo}

\begin{pcecode}
fileviewer(Dir) :-
	new(F, frame('File Viewer')),
	send(F, append(new(B, browser))),
	send(new(D, dialog), below(B)),
	send(D, append(button(view,
			      message(@prolog, view,
				      B?selection?key)))),
	send(D, append(button(quit,
			      message(F, destroy)))),
	send(B, members(directory(Dir)?files)),
	send(F, open).

view(F) :-
	send(new(V, view(F)), open),
	send(V, load(F)).
\end{pcecode}

The main window of the application consists of a \class{frame} holding
two specialised \class{window} instances. A \class{frame} is a
collection of {\em tiled} windows. Any opened window in \product{} is enclosed
in a \class{frame}. The windows are positioned using the methods
->above, ->below, ->right and ->left. The frame ensures that its member
windows are properly aligned and handles resizing of the frame.  See
also \secref{framelayout}.

In line 3, a \class{browser} is ->append{}ed to the frame object. A
browser is a window specialised for displaying a list of objects.
Browsers handle very large numbers of items efficiently.  Next,
a \class{dialog} is positioned below the browser.  A dialog is
a window specialised in handling the layout of controllers, or
\class{dialog_item} objects as \product{} calls them.

Line 5 adds a \class{button} to the dialog. `view' specifies the {\em
name} of the button. \product{} defines a central mapping from `dialog_item
<->name' to the label displayed. The default mapping capitalises the
name and replaces underscores with spaces. In \secref{multi-lingual}, we
describe how this can be used to realise multi-lingual applications. The
second argument of the button specifies the {\em action} associated with
the button. A \class{message} is a dormant send-operation. When pressed,
the button executes

\begin{code}
send(@prolog, view, B?selection?key)
\end{code}

If a message is sent to @prolog, this calls a predicate with the name of
the {\em selector} of the message and an arity that equals the number of
arguments to the message (1 here).

The argument is a term with principal functor \class{?} and defines an
`obtainer', a dormant get-operation. It is defined as a Prolog
infix operator of type {\tt yfx}, priority 500. This implies that
\mbox{\tt B?selection?key} should be read as%
    \footnote{Initial versions of \product{} lacked the obtainer.  In this
	      case the browser {\em B} would be passed to the predicate
	      view/1, which would extract the current filename from the
	      browser.  Obtainers improve the readability and avoid the
	      need to mix UI related code with application code.}

\begin{code}
?(?(B, selection), key)
\end{code}

The result of the get-operation <-selection on a browser returns the
\class{dict_item} object currently selected.  Dict-items are the
elements of a \class{dict}, the underlying data object of a browser.
A \class{dict_item} consists of a <-key (its identifier), a <-label
(the visual text) and optionally an associated <-object.

Line 8 appends a second button to the dialog window.  The dialog window
will automatically align this one to the right of the first.  The action
sends a message directly to another \product{} object and ->destroys the
frame object if the quit button is pressed.  Note that this will erase
all UI objects associated with the frame.  The garbage collector 
destroys all related objects.

Line 10 fills the \class{browser} with the files from the specified
directory. The expression \mbox{\tt directory(Dir)?files} defines an
obtainer operating on an instance of class \class{directory}. The
obtainer evaluates to a \class{chain}, \product{}'s notion of a list, holding
the names of all files in the directory. This expression is the same as:

\begin{code}
	...,
	new(Dobj, directory(Dir)),
	get(Dobj, files, Chain),
	send(B, members, Chain),
	...
\end{code}

Again, the garbage collector takes care of the directory and chain
objects.  The browser automatically converts the given names to
\class{dict_item} objects.%
    \footnote{This conversion is implemented with class
	      \class{dict_item}.  In fact, the browser just specifies
	      the desired type and the message passing kernel invokes
	      the conversion method of class \class{dict_item}.}

Finally, the frame is ->open{}ed.  This will cause the frame to ask
each of the windows to compute its desired size, after which the
frame aligns the windows, decides on their final geometry and creates
the Window-system counterpart.

The view/1 callback predicate simply opens an instance of \class{view},
a window specialised in text-editing and loads the file into the view.
The method `view ->load' expects an instance of class \class{file}.
Again, the type-conversion will deal with this. 


\section{Summary}

\product{}'s world consists of objects. An object is an entity with persistent
state that belongs to a class. The \productpl{} interface defines four
basic predicates, new/2 to create objects from a description and returns
an object reference, send/[2-12] to change the state of an object and
succeeds if the requested change could be made, get/[3-13] to request an
object to compute a value and return it, and free/1 to remove objects
from the \product{} database.

Objects of the \class{message} are `dormant' send operations.  They
may be activated by other objects (button, text_item, ...).  In this
case a send operation is started.  Objects of class \class{?} are called
{\em \idx{obtainer}} and represent `dormant' get operations.  The `?'
sign is defined as a prolog infix operator, allowing for constructs
as:

\begin{code}
	send(Frame, height, Frame?display?height)
\end{code}

The object @prolog (class \class{host}) allows calling Prolog predicates
from the \product{} environment.
