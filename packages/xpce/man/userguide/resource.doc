\chapter{Using resources}		\label{sec:resources}


With the term {\em resources} we actually refer to {\em preferences}
similar to X11. Resources in \product{} act like class-variables for which a
default is specified by the application programmer. The application may
overrule this default by specifying its value in a \idx{resource-file}.

Earlier versions of the X11 version of \product{} used the X11 resource
services.  As the syntax of \product{} resources is different from what
is handled by the Xt and related libraries, this often lead to 
unexpected behaviour of \product{}-based applications.

Therefore, recent versions of the X11 implementation use the resource
emulator developed for the Win32 version.  The resources are read from
the file{\$PCEHOME/Pce}, which includes \file{~/.Xpce} if present.

Only if no value is found in one of the resource files, the default
defined with the resource declaration in the \product{} class definition is
used. This is also the case if a value is defined, but contains syntax
errors or is otherwise not a legal description for the resource.

Note that the Win32 version is shipped with a totally different resource
file, emulating the Windows 95 look-and-feel.


\section{Specifying xpce resources}

\product{} is known by the X11 application {\tt Pce}.  An \product{} resource
specification takes the following form:

\begin{quote}
{\tt Pce.}<CapitalisedClass>{\tt .}<attribute>{\tt :} <Value>
\end{quote}

<CapitalisedClass> denotes a capitalised version of the class-name, were
underscores are deleted and the subsequent letter is capitalised. For
example, {\em Point}, {\em ListBrowser}. <attribute> denotes the
`class-variable' specified. The online manual ClassBrowser may be used
to examine the available resources and their current value.

The resource-class {\tt Pce} can be changed using
`display ->resource_class'.


\section{Resource-value syntax}

The syntax for resource-{\em values} used by \product{} is in general not the
same as the syntax used by X11.   Exceptions are integer, boolean and
colour resources.  Resource values are specified as \product{} objects.  The
syntax is inspired by Prolog.  Below is a partial BNF description.

\def\isa{}
\def\ora{}
\renewcommand{\isa}{&    ::= &}
\renewcommand{\ora}{& $\mid$ &}
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{|lrl|}
\hline
<Any>			\isa <int>		\\
			\ora <float>		\\
			\ora <Name>		\\
			\ora @<Name>		\\
			\ora <Chain>		\\
			\ora <Object>		\\
\hline
<Chain>			\isa {\tt [} <Any> \{, <Any>\} {\tt ]} \\
			\ora {\tt [} {<Blank>} {\tt ]} \\
\hline
<Object>		\isa <ClassName>{\tt ()} \\
			\ora <ClassName>{\tt (} <Any> \{, <Any>\} {\tt )} \\
			\ora <PrefixOp> <Any> \\
			\ora <Any> <InfixOp> <Any> \\
			\ora <Any> <PostfixOp> \\
			\ora {\tt "} <String> {\tt "} \\
\hline
<String>		\isa \{<CharNotDoubleQuote>$|${\tt ""}\} \\
\hline
<Name>			\isa <Letter>\{<Letter>$|$<Digit>\} \\
			\ora {\tt '} \{<CharNotSingleQuote>$|${\tt ''}\} {\tt '} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

Summarising, the syntax is the same as for Prolog.  All classes that can
be specified using Prolog operators can be specified the same way, but
as \product{}'s parser is independent of Prolog, Prolog op/3 directives do not
influence \product{}.  \product{} has no variables, thus {\tt Fred} refers to the
name {\em Fred} rather then defining a variable.  If an instance has
to be created without arguments, such as and empty \class{chain} object,
this is specified as {\tt chain()} rather than {\tt new(chain)}.  The
latter will try to make an instance of class \class{new} (and fail).


\subsection{Long lines in resource files}

X11 allows resource values that do not fit on a single line to be
continued on the next line if the newline is {\em immediately}
preceded by a backslash.


\section{Resources and inheritance}

Resources are inherited by subclasses.  If a resource value needs to be
obtained, \product{} will first check for the resource value given the current
class.  If this cannot be found, it will continue with the super-class,
etc.  If no value can be obtained for any of these classes, the default
value stored in the resource object will be used.  This implies that
the statement

\begin{code}
Pce.Text.font:	normal
\end{code}

also applies for all subclasses of class text, unless the subclass
explicitly defines a new font resource.%
    \footnote{If the resource-file specifies {\tt Pce.*.font: normal},
	      its value will apply for all classes defining a font
	      resource due to the way the X11 resource handler is
	      defined.  The X11 resource handler will use the most
	      specific specification.}


\section{Obtaining resource settings}

Obtaining resources is normally restricted to user-defined classes
(\chapref{udc}).

\begin{description}
    \predicate{default}{3}{+Arg, resource(+Obj, +Name), -Value}
This predicate is described in \secref{udcpreds}.
    \getmethod{object}{resource_value}{name}{value}
Get the value of the named resource.  Fails if the resource does
not exist or cannot be converted.
    \sendmethod{object}{obtain_resources}{}
Exclusively in the context of user-defined classes.  This method
obtains the resource value for any slot with value @default, whose
type declaration does not accept @default.
\end{description}
