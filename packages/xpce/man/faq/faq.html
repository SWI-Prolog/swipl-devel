<H1>Programmers FAQ for XPCE</H1>
</center>

This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for XPCE.
This list contains question about programming problems in XPCE.<p>
PCE is an object-oriented  library for the development of user
interfaces, meant to be connected to symbolic languages.<p>

 The authors of XPCE are <b>Anjo Anjewierden</b> and <b>Jan Wielemaker</b>
at the Department of Social Science Informatics, 
 University of Amsterdam (<a
href="http://swi.psy.uva.nl/">SWI</a>).<p>

This is not the only FAQ list for XPCE.  <A
HREF="http://swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/xpcefaq.html">Another one
</A> 
is maintained by Jan Wielemaker and describes general
things such as `What is XPCE?' and `How do I get XPCE for ...?'.
<p>
<b>Maintainer's note:</b> the questions at the beginning of each
section are likely to be addressed to beginners (nomina sunt
consequentia rerum :-).

  <li> XPCE Course Notes (about 50 pages)
  <li> XPCE User Guide   (about 100 pages)
  <li> Examples (PceDraw, various other library routines depending

<A NAME="askquestions"><h2>Where can I ask questions about
	 XPCE?</h2></A>

<p> The best thing is to consult this FAQ, first, and to eventually
send a message to the <A href="mailto:xpce@swi.psy.uva.nl">XPCE mailing
list (xpce@swi.psy.uva.nl)</A>.  XPCE is not Prolog, so it is better
not to post on <a href="news:comp.lang.prolog">comp.lang.prolog</A>.

<A NAME="singleuser"><H2>Is it possible to have a single-user PC
	 version of XPCE ?</h2></A>

<p><b>
&gt; I'm a student of Computer Science at Universita' Degli Studi<br>
&gt; di Milano; I'd like to use xpce library for Windows<br>
&gt; How can I get it?</b>

<P>As yet, we don't have any student arrangements.  There are three ways
to run XPCE/SWI-Prolog.  First is to make your university obtain for
a licence.  Second is to install Linux, for which there is a free
version (anonymous ftp from our site) and third is to apply for
a licence yourself, but I understand this is rather expensive for
personal use.  It is not unlikely there will be a student version
of Quintus/XPCE in the future.

<A NAME="clispversion"><h2>Is there an XPCE version which
	 interfaces with Clisp?</h2></A>
<p><b>
&gt; my supervisor has been insisting<br>
&gt; that there should be a version of xpce which would interface<br>
&gt; with clisp (he already uses it with SWI prolog), and I have<br>
&gt; either find one or prove that it doesn't exist...<br>
&gt; I know from your documentation that there are Lucid and<br>
&gt; Lispwork versions, has clisp ever been attempted and what would it<br>
&gt; take to develop an interface between them if we were to<br>
&gt; attempt it? (unlikely)</b>

<p>You're right that it doesn't exists.  I know some people have expressed
interrest in this, but sofar no people with sufficient Clisp knowledge
or just not enough time to make the connection.  I think that if clisp
provides a documented foreign-language interface, it shouldn't be
too hard, as most of the interface is written in Lisp and there are
already two lisp bindings with Lisps with quite different features.
<P>
You could try the mailing list xpce@swi.psy.uva.nl (maybe someone has
something or, with some support from your site wants to implement it).
If you come across something, please inform me.

<a name="prowinpce"><h2>What is the difference between XPCE and
	 ProWindows 3.0?</h2></A>

<p>XPCE is the academic product.  ProWindows-3 is a commercial version
of it.  This implies it is generally the previous release with bugs
fixed.  So, XPCE offers more functionality and more bugs :-)

<a name="pcequintus"><h2>Would it be possible to take XPCE for
	 SICStus and adapt it to Quintus?</h2></A>

<p>Yes, but you'll have to write the interface yourself.  This is not
a lot of 
code, but requires good knowledge of C, XPCE and the foreign interface of
Quintus.  It requires Quintus 3.14 or later (due to bugs there).

<a name="licencecond"><h2>What are the licencing conditions for
	 XPCE for an academic institution?</h2></A>

<p>A licence including the whole lot (sources, interfaces and SWI-Prolog)
costs 500 ECU (about $600).  This is `as-is' basis; you'll have to 
compile and install the system yourself.  You can only use this system
for `non-comercial' purposes, which implies you cannot sell products
that include it.  Documentation is only on-line and in PostScript
format.

<a name="prowincomp"><h2>Is XPCE upward compatible with
	 ProWindows 2.1?</h2></A>

<p>No.  It provides the same terminoligy, style and predicates though.
Adapting source-code is generally not too hard, but it depends on
the quality of your original code (of course).  The AIIL version
contains some ported libraries.
<p>
For short, the history is this:
<xmp>
                                              | -ProWindows-3 (XPCE-4.7.2
                                              |  with fixes, AIIL)
 PCE-1.0 -- PCE 2.0 --- PCE 3.0 --- XPCE-4.0 --- XPCE-4.8.0 (Academic)
  (AA)       (AA)       (AA&JW)      (JW)          (JW)
               |
               |--------ProWindows-1 -- ProWindows-2
                        (Quintus)       (Quintus)
</xmp>
Where (AA) is Anjo Anjewierden (UvA) and JW is Jan Wielemaker (me,
UvA).  PCE-3 adds simple programming facilities; XPCE-4 moved to X11,
integrated graphics and dialog windows and provided full OO
programming facilities to the application programmer, an extensive
Prolog library and fully integrated online manual system.
<p>
In general PW3 is *much* faster, poses hardly any limits on what you can
achieve and allows you to write much shorter programs.  It is far too much
to explain in a few lines.  You can ftp the documentation from this
site (ftp.swi.psy.uva.nl:/pub/xpce/doc/...).

<a name="multiplatforms"><h2>Can XPCE really work on such an
	 heterogeneous system of different platforms?</h2></A>
<p><b>
&gt; in search for a tool to build graphical user interfaces for<br>
&gt; our applications that will run on a variety of platforms we found XPCE
<br>&gt; (actually in the disguise of ProWindows offered by Quintus - the
<br>&gt; project I'm working in does application development using Prolog). Now
<br>&gt; other people got interested in the tool and the question is, which
<br>&gt; platforms are actually supported rigth now, will be soon or could be
<br>&gt; later... In my project we are looking at different UNIX platforms and
<br>&gt; OS/2, other groups want to support OS/2, DOS/Windows and MAC. As far
<br>&gt; as I know (from Quintus) our UNIX platforms are OK, and OS/2 PM will
<br>&gt; be available later this year. Also, DOS/Windows is supported. I don't
<br>&gt; know about MAC...</b>.


<p>PowerMacs claim to run MS-Windows apps, so this should in theory work.
There are no concrete plans for a native MAC version.  If plans are
really big it can be discussed.  The XPCE machine interfaces to a
(XPCE) defined `virtual windowing interface'.  Implementations thereof
currently exist for MS-Windows and X11.  This bit is about 200 KB for
X11 and 160 KB for MS-Windows and takes about a month for an experienced
C programmer with relevant experience to implement.  XPCE itself
is strict ANSI C and should be easily ported.  So it all depends on
how much copies you want to have :-)

<p>No.  XPCE defines it's own GUI standards, currently closely confirming
OpenLook and a bit less closely Motif.  You can run XPCE using any of
its supporting styles on any platform it runs on.  Applications are
independent of the look-and-feel preferred by the user, as long as
they use the high-level UI specification (it is also possible to
do nitty-gritty low-level manipulations, but these may give strange
results if the user switches UI preferences).
<p>
Future versions are supposed to conform much closer to established
GUI standards.  Motif will be the first supported in much more detail.

<h1>Runtime and related issues</h1>

<a name="makestandalone">
  <h2>How do I make stand-alone executables?</h2></a>

<p>The methods described here apply to XPCE/SWI-Prolog.
     Many comments will also apply to other host-languages, but the
     details may be different.

<p><a name="writescript"><h3>Writing a shell-script.</h3></a>

<p>If the program is small  (i.e.   loads   quickly),  just  write
     a small <a name="32"><b>shell-script</b></a> that loads and
     starts the  program.  Using SWI-Prolog, this becomes:

<p><xmp>        #!/bin/sh

        xpce -g '[/usr/local/src/myprog],startmyprog'
</xmp>
     
See SWI-Prolog command-line options for details.    This is often a good
     choice, but requires your adience to have access to the XPCE
     development environment.  It will automatically pick the  most
     recent version of the system.

<p><a name="createcompiled"><h3>Create a compiled program.</h3></a>

<p>You  may  <a name="8gc"><b>compile</b></a>  your  program  into    a
     self-starting  script  for XPCE/SWI-Prolog using the command:

<p><xmp>        % xpce -o myprog -c prologfile ...
</xmp>
See  SWI-Prolog  command-line  options  for  details.   There  are
     some limitations on what can be handled by   the `-c' compiler
option.  Check the SWI-Prolog manual for details.

<p><a name="createsavedstate"><h3>Create a saved-state.</h3></a>

<p>Using save/1 or <a name="29"><b>save_program</b></a>/1 and friends,
you can create a saved state of the process that can be started
directly from the shell.  SWI-Prolog saved states start quickly,  but
are  completely  non-portable accross different machine architectures.

<p>The xpce executable is a <a name="30"><b>saved-state</b></a>!
<p>If you decide to make a saved-state, make sure the connection to the
X11 display is not opened before making   the state.  Opening the
connection will distribute the XPCE process  state   over  both the
XPCE executable itself and the X11 server process,  making   it
impossible  to create a snapshot of it.

<p>There is only a little hack to test that the display opened:

<p><xmp>        ?- get(@display, slot, ws_ref, X).
</xmp>
Which will yield  `0'  if  the  display   is  not  opened  and  non-zero
otherwise.  To find out *when* the display is opened, use:

<p><xmp>        ?- debugpce(display).
</xmp>
which will cause xpce to print:

<p><xmp>        Opening display @display
</xmp>
at the moment the display is opened.

<p>Normally, you should just load  the   program  before creating the
saved state.  Notably, you should  not  create   any  graphical objects
using Prolog directives as this will request the associated resources and
thus requires XPCE to open the connection to the X-server (that maintains
the X11 resource database).  
Use the  :-   pce_global/2  directive  for such cases, which will
delay the creation of   the  object till the object is referred too.

<p><a name="runtimelicence"><h2>Runtime licenses</h2></a>

<p>Right now, there is no <a name="28"><b>runtime</b></a>  generator for
XPCE/SWI-Prolog.  This -in principle- forces users of your program to
buy an XPCE licence in order to run your program.

<p>In the future we will create a runtime  version of the library that
will be fully compatible  as  far  as   running  a  developed
application is concerned, but will lack essential features to use it as
a development environment.  We will grant licence-holders the right
to distribute this runtime library free of royalties.

<p>In the meanwhile, contact us if you have  concrete plans and we will
try to get to an acceptable  solution.   In   most  cases  this will
involve creating some sort of saved-state of the program.

<h1>General Programming issues</h1>

<A NAME="consistentgraph"><h2>I'd like to know the best way
	     for implementing a graph
	     editor which must be consistent with the
	     Prolog internal representation</h2></A>
<b>
&gt;  In my application (a graph editor, as far as you are concerned), I<br>
&gt; need to keep an exact correspondence between the graph and a set of<br>
&gt; Prolog facts. I have implemented it by associating a different Prolog<br>
&gt; predicate which asserts and/or retracts facts to each action aimed at<br>
&gt; manipulating the graph.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;  Even though response to user events is still good, I suspect that<br>
&gt; it is a bad programming habit.<br> 
&gt;  Furthermore, if I keep implementing complex responses to user<br>
&gt; events this way, I'm afraid problems might eventually show up.<br> 
&gt; <br>
&gt;  A better approach might be to concentrate on the graphical part<br>
&gt; without bothering about the Prolog database. At the right moment, the<br>
&gt; application would take a walk through the user-produced graph and<br>
&gt; interactively assert the right facts by exploitation of the<br>
&gt; connections.</b>
<p>
This is a complex issue.  Surely the simplest implementation is where
you see the relevant clauses of the Prolog database as a file (archive)
you use to read (clauses --&gt; graphical editor) and write (graphical
editor --&gt; new clauses).

However, there are various cases in which this is not good enough.
Suppose you have a set of clauses and you want to have multiple
simultaneously operating editors that exploit diffent views on the
same data.  Using the read/write approach, this implies the user
cannot use bot editors simultaneously to manipulate the database,
but needs a lock/unlock schema.  At lock, the contents of the other
editors is invalidated and at unlock all editors need to be updated.
This is unpleasant for the user and conflicts with the idea of neat
direct manipulation.

A better aproach is to define a database and a minimal set of
predicates to manipulate this database.  All user actions that
affect the database are mapped into manipulations on this minimal
set.  Each editor watches the manipulations and updates its
graphical representation accordingly.  You can use various changes
caching mechanisms here for speedup if necessary.

This has been discussed in a paper for the UIST 89 by me and Anjo
Anjewierden, which you can obtain <a href="uims.uist89.ps.gz">here</a>
or from:

	<A href="ftp://swi.psy.uva.nl/pub/xpce/doc/uims.uist89.ps.gz">
	ftp://swi.psy.uva.nl/pub/xpce/doc/uims.uist89.ps.gz</A>
</center>
Anjo and me ar currently working on a reusable implementation of a
successor of this schema for the Esprit project KACTUS.  This library
is likely to become part of future XPCE releases.

This library basically provides a global structure for applications
(and is thus much less flexible as XPCE in this sense).

<p><a name="hiddeninfo"><h2>How do I attach hidden information
	     to a device object? I'd like to keep related information
	     in a self-contained package.</h2></A>
<p><b>
&gt;  Since I've taken the approach to "assert" the user produced-graph<br>
&gt; into the prolog database only when it's complete, I now face the<br>
&gt; problem to attach "hidden information" to a device node.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;  When the user creates a new node, (s)he is prompted with a dialog<br>
&gt; which determines some of the features of the icon.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;  The dialog gets further information which, although not immediately<br>
&gt; reflected in the graphical representation, I'd like to retrieve later<br>
&gt; on, if the icon still exists without explicitly saving them in a<br>
&gt; different location (this would pose a consistency problem).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;  Do you think attaching the "invisible" info to the device is a good<br>
&gt; idea? </b>
<p>
*If* you decide (as you did) for the idea that a graphical
representation of some part of the Prolog database is created, the
(graphical) representation is modified and the result is used to
replace the old Prolog database, I guess it makes sense to ensure
the loaded/edited/saved information is an (as good a possible)
self-contained pack of data.
<p>
So, suppose you have a graph and the nodes have attributes (which is
what I deduce from your description).  It could be that the nodes are
entities themselves (i.e.  can exists without the graph) and the graph
(possibly multiple graphs) represent some structure(s) of the database.
In this case, I would design a Prolog database where nodes are self
contained packages with some identifier and the graphs are self
contained packages using the node identifiers.  The graph editor(s) just
manipulate the graph.  If you want to have a dialog for manipulating the
data of a node, the dialog will load the existing info and store it back
once the user is finished editing the node attributes
<p>
On the other hand, if a node with its attribute makes no sense outside
the graph, a single self-contained database representing the combination
might be a better solution.  In that case it might be logical to store
the node attribute values with the graphical representation.

<p><b> 
&gt;  What's the best way to achieve this?</b>
<p>
There are essentially three natural ways to store such information with
graphicals:
<OL>
  <li>Using object-level attributes
    This is done with the methods `object <->attribute'.  Object-level
    attributes are dynamic but relatively expensive it you needs *lots*
    of them (The attributes are in a linked list and each attribute
    needs to store both the name of the attribute and the value).

  <li>Using subclasses
    Just make variable declarations for the extra data you need to
    store.  Basically the same as above, but you can exploit XPCE's
    typing for consistency and it is cheaper in terms of memory.  On
    the other hand, you may need to define a lot of classes.

  <li>Using a sheet
    You can attach sheet object to the graphical (using a subclass or
    object-level attribute).  This nicely packages the info together.

</OL>

Of course, you can make combinations of the above solutions.  In all
cases, the additional data will automatically be GC'ed if the graphical
is destroyed.

<p><b>
&gt;  Pag. 33 of the Programming Manual. You warn against confusing PCE<br>

</xmp>
<b>&gt; but I can't get a confirmation since verbose is note defined.</b>
<p>  
Your suspicion is accurate, but you have to define a Prolog predicate
<b>verbose/1</b>, of course.
Verbose is supposed to be something of your application.  For
example:
<xmp>
:- dynamic verbose/1.

dformat(Fmt, Args) :-
	verbose(on), !,
	format(Fmt, Args).
dformat(_,_).

	...
	dformat('Now trying to fly~n', []),
	...
</xmp>
in this context, the example dialog would be a natural way to control
`verboseness', but doesn't work, so you have to use your example and
define
<xmp>
verbose(Val) :-
	retractall(verbose(_)),
	assert(verbose(Val)).

If the text_item is to produce an integer, the best is to register this
with the text_item:
<xmp>
	...
	new(TI, text_item(npwg)),
	send(TI, type, int),
	...
</xmp>
In this case, the returned value will be an integer.  If the typed value
cannot be converted an error is raised by the text_item and <-selection
will fail.
<p>
Once you have an atom, you can either use the Prolog primitives name/2
and/or number_chars/2 or explicitely invoke XPCE's type testing:
<xmp>
	?- get(type(int), check, '45', X).

<p>This will transform the

are two ways of converting:

	?- get(type(name), check, String, Atom).

The first works for all subclasses of char_array, the second for

<p>
There isn't anything else (<a href="#listhackaround">but...</a>).
It is also difficult to imagine anything
else.  One solution would be to allow for passing Prolog datastructures:
<xmp>
	...,
	send(Button, message(@prolog, call, prolog(assert(foo, bar)))),
	...,
</xmp>
Now, unfortunately if you pass a Prolog reference to the term
assert(foo, bar) you are faced with the fact that the lifetime of the
Prolog term is not unlikely to end before the lifetime of the button.
<p>
So, the only way would be to translate this into:
<xmp>
	...,
	record('$pce_term', assert(foo, bar), Ref),
	send(Button, message(@prolog, call, prolog(Ref))),
	...,
</xmp>
and let the interface make the reverse translation.  This feature would
allow for passing arbitrary Prolog data over the XPCE interface,
although one should realise that what is passed is actually a *copy*
of the original, and this all bindings will be lost, so you still can't
do
<xmp>
	?- send(@prolog, call, prolog(get0(C))).
</xmp>
It will call ok, but as the call will be executed on a copy of the term,
the variable C will remain unbound.
<p>
The XPCE <-> CommonLisp interface implements a schema like this which
is used commonly to associate a lambda function with a GUI object.

&gt; Do you think it's a good idea or would you use an alternative?<br>
&gt; Is there any problem (dangling references, for ex:) if the user<br>
&gt; deletes one of the products?</b>
<p>
It will (should :-) do what you expect it to do.  There won't be
any dangling references as constraints are know to the object
management system and automatically deleted.
<p>
Problem with this approach is that *any* send-message arriving on the
device will cause the constraints to be evaluated.  Depending on the
complexity of the application, this might noticible slow down the
application.
<p>
I would be tempted to split the product object into the graphical
object and a second object (subclass of class object) holding the
data.  If you then use a hyper object to relate the graphical and
storage object, you can just create a second hyper to the second
graphical representation and the job is done. Consider <a
href="#guifunctsep">this example</a>.

<p><b>&gt;  In the case in which you assert an<br>
&gt; identity on two attributes which already possess different values,<br>
&gt; which one prevails?</b>

On initialisation, the constraint is executed in the `forwards'
direction: the second object is made consistent with the first.

<p><a name="classvar"><h2>Class Variables</h2></a>

<p>XPCE only offers `instance variables'.
There are three ways to represent common data at the class level:

<p><ul><li> Using resources.  This is normally used if the shared
     data concerns some sort of user-preferences.  See class resource.

<p><li> Using attributes at the class-level: 

<p>     <xmp>send(@class, attribute, my_attribute, my_value).</xmp>

<p>After which you can use the following to retrieve the value:

<p>     <xmp>get(Instance?class, my_attribute, MyValue)
</xmp>
<li> By refining class class and making your classes a subclass thereof:

<p>     <xmp>:- pce_begin_class(my_class, class).

        variable(my_variable,   my_type, both).
        :- pce_end_class.
        </xmp>
        <a name="my_class"><xmp>:- new(_, my_class(my_object, object)).

        :- send(@class, my_variable, my_value).

        ...

        :- pce_end_class.</xmp>

<p>After which you can use the following to retrieve the value:

<p>     <xmp>get(Instance?class, my_attribute, MyValue)</xmp>
</ul>
<p>Note, the explicit creation of <a href="#my_class">my_class</a>
is necessary.  When omitted, :- pce_begin_class will create a normal
class (instance of class class).

<p>Close. Obtainers either return an object or the exception code `failure'
(get(Obj, selector, X) returns object or fails).  So, find the first
link from the chain for which the obtainer returns a non-failure value.
<p>
During execution of the obtainer, @arg1 is bound to the currently
tried link object.  @arg1?from thus refers to the name of the handle on
the `from' side of the connection (link).  So, te obtainer returns
a chain of handle objects iff Graphical has one or more handles with the
requested name.  See graphical <-handles: the get operation faiulks if no
matching handles can be found (instead of returning an empty chain.

<p><b>&gt; How was I supposed to consult the documentation on line in<br>

The problem is the moment of evaluation.  In your case the

pce_global trap is executed (i.e. the first reference to the object
@open (b.t.w. a bit too general name for a global reference).  The
trick is to write  function that returns a string:

	create(string, 'You want to model a %s', @receiver?name)

is a function object, than -when executed- creates what you want.  By
the way, the ->report mechanism is likely to do what you want much
simple and more general.  See visual ->report for documentation.  Your

<p>
??? Just assert the reference if you want.  So:

        assert(node(hello, Node)),
        ...

You can also keep the references in a Prolog list (which is much better
style):
<xmp>
        display_arcs(Window, Arcs) :-
                display_arcs(Arcs, Window, []).

        display_arcs([], _, _).
        display_arcs([arc(From, To)|Rest], Window, D0) :-

                ensure_displayed(Window, To, ToRef, D1, D2),
                new(_, connection(FromRef, ToRef)),
                display_arcs(Rest, Window, D2).

        ensure_displayed(_, Node, Ref, D, D) :-
                memberchk(Node=Ref, D), !.
        ensure_displayed(Window, Node, Ref, D, [Node=Ref|D]) :-

<p>
Well, you *do* need a reference to something. I guess you know where to
find the picture window displaying the graph. Now, how you collect the
graph depends on what database representation you have for it. The
simplest way is to simply enumerate the arcs (represented as
connections) and convert them:
<xmp>
	...
	send(Picture?graphicals, for_all,
	     if(message(@arg1, instance_of, connection),
		message(@prolog, store_connection, @arg1))),
	...

store_connection(Connection) :-
	get(Connection, from, From),
	get(Connection, to, To),
	<map the nodes to a sensible Prolog representation>,
	<determine the type of the connectionif applicable>,
	<assert the fact(s) for this arc>
</xmp>
<b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;  2) How do I make sure I don't get in a loop.</b>
<p>
The above example surely terminates.  If you have a start-node, you can
build the graph by asking the node for its <-connections and recursively
continue.  Keep a list of visited connection objects to avoid a loop.

<p>

also have implemented this using (not tested):

<xmp> 
         new(D, dialog('Test Dialog')), 
         send(D, append, text_item('Vorname')), 
         send(D, append, button('OK', message(D, destroy))),

         repeat,
              send(@display, dispatch),
              \+ object(D), !.

<p>
How do you mean `undefined'?  If you just want to store the plain ASCII
text, use a string object for the storage.  Use &lt;-&gt;contents to save/load
the string into an editor (&lt;-&gt;contents is delegated to/from
text_buffer).
<p>
TextBuffers are a far too specific class for storing just plain text
(although they *could* be used for that).
<xmp>

</xmp>
The argument of Editor->text_buffer is a text_buffer object, so it
should not be TCode?contents, but plainly TCode.

Rebind the return key and do whatever you like.  Basically:
<xmp>
	send(Editor, key_binding, 'RET', message(...)).
</xmp>
also remember to include this message if you are interested in
maintaining the default carriage return behaviour.

<p><b>
&gt;  Here is my problem, I need to make a dialog containing three small<br>

<p>
The combination of ->append and a subsequent ->right doesn't work

->append by default puts objects below each other, which the exception
of multiple buttons, which are places left-to-right.  If you want
other objects left-to-right, using ->append: object, right.

->right should give a warning instead of succeeding silently.

<p>
Basically, yes! In order  to
drag-and-drop and object, just connect a drag-and-drop gesture
to it.  To receive an object, define the methods ->drop and
if you like, ->preview_drop (for feedback while dragging).
<p>
->drop is defined with at least one argument.  If it is defined with
two and the latter accepts a point, the current location of the cursor
relative to the drop-zone is reported (see ->terminate method of the
gesture class).  The type-check of the first argument may be used to
only accept objects of specified type (but of course, you can also
just fail in ->drop if you don't like the object).

<P>No.  The best way to implement them would be to refine class
connection.  The skeleton for this would be something like
this:

<xmp>

compute(C) :->

	    ;   send(C, displayed, @off)
	    )
	).
	    
:- pce_end_class.

</xmp>

<p>Note that the engine requires handles to exist.  I would create a handle
at the center of the graphicals to be connected.

<p>It may be easier to create a handle in the center, ensure the
graphical is opaque (using -&gt; fill_pattern for example) and the
connection is hidden behind the connected graphicals.  See graphical
-&gt; hide.  This will work regardless of the shape of the graphical!

<p>
The trick is to intercept the communication from the scrollbars to the
picture window.  As the documentation tells me the window receives
- &gt; scroll_vertical and - &gt; scroll_horizontal messages to handle the two
scrollbars.<p>

I've chosen for a little demo that intercepts both messages and forwards
them to other windows related using a hyper object.  The advantage of
hypers in this context is twofold: they implement a broadcasting
mechanism and the XPCE kernel will properly destroy the hyper-relation
if either of the windows is destroyed, avoiding dangling references.<p>

Both windows may be, but need not be in the same frame for the code
below to work.<p>

Note that a window is the same as a picture without scrollbars.<p>

&gt;  I thought that I just needed to specialize "terminate" too and not have<br>

&gt;  As you expect, the problem is that "terminate" also took care of<br>
&gt; getting rid of the line and handles indicator which remain on the<br>
&gt; screen even though the connection is not drawn</b>
<p>
From the manual, I read:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	connect_gesture-><b>terminate</b>: event<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Invokes -><b>drag</b>.  Next removes the <-<b>line</b> and the
indicatorbitmaps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	from the <-<b>device</b> and finally invokes -><b>connect</b> using the
following<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	arguments:<br>

<p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=10 CELLSPACING=10>
       <TR>
		 <TD>
                `event<-receiver'<br>
		<-to<br>
                <-link<br>
		<-from_handle<br>
		<-to_handle</TD>

        	<TD>
                The `from' graphical<br>
		The `to' graphical<br>
		The <-link<br>
		Handle name at the `from' side<br>
		Handle name at the `to' side</TD>
      </TR>
</TABLE>

<p>
So, the correct method to redefine is the ->connect method.  The
terminate method should always invoke the super-class method unless
you want to be sure to get into compatibility problems with next
releases.  The ->connect of the generic class simply makes an instance
of the link (a connection), but you can do anything you like instead.

<p>
The proper way to do this is by exploiting the `graphical ->resize'
method, which takes x- and y scale factors and an `origin' (that may
be outside the graphical).  An example is PceDraw's facility to resize
a collection of graphicals (select multiple graphicals and resize the
bounding box).
<p>
Somewhere in the many plans is to introduce a scale-factor at the level
of class device.  Together with rotate, this would provide the system

<xmp>
:- pce_begin_class(p_string, string).

changed(S) :->
	"Forward new value to visualisations"::
	send(S, send_hyper, v, value, S).

value(S, V:char_array) :->
	(   send(S, equal, V)
	->  true
	;   send(S, send_super, value, V),
	    send(S, changed)
	).

:- pce_end_class.

:- pce_begin_class(v_text_item, text_item).

:- pce_global(@v_text_message,
	      new(message(@receiver, send_hyper, p, value, @arg1))).

initialise(TI, Label:name, P:p_string) :->
	send(TI, send_super,
	     initialise, Label, P?value, @v_text_message),
	new(_, hyper(TI, P, p, v)).

:- pce_end_class.


test :-
	new(@s, p_string(hello)),
	send(v_text_item(test, @s), open).
</xmp>

Next, you can try:
<xmp>
	?- test.
	?- send(@s, value, gnu).
	<item shows `gnu'>
	<type gnat RETURN in the item>
	?- get(@s, value, X).
	X = gnat
</xmp>
Depending on your total architecture, you can also use the class
- &gt; changed_message for trapping object changes.

Otherwise, yes, you can
change the look of both the editor and its scrollbar.  Just look at the

<p>Basically you cannot manipulate pixels in a PCE Window.  No panic however.
If you want to read a window's picture, make an image object of the same
size as the window and draw the graphicals in there.  Next you can read
the pixels from the image.  This would look something like this:
<xmp>
picture_to_image(P, I) :-
        get(P, visible, area(X, Y, W, H)),
        new(I, image(@nil, W, H, pixmap)),
        new(M1, point(-X, -Y)),
        new(M2, point(X, Y)),

                 message(@arg1, relative_move, M2))).
</xmp>
After which image <-pixel wil finish the job.

<p><b> I would appreciate any help or pointers. Thanks in advance...</b>

<p>The only way to write pixels in a picture is to display a bitmap on
the picture and write the pixels in the bitmap.

<H1>Performance and Errors</H1>

<hr><A NAME="penperformance"><h2>Why are graphical operations so
	   incredibly slowed down on my machine when I use <b>pen &gt;
	   1</b>?</h2></A>
<p><b>
&gt; Your last remark seems to be quite relevant here. I.e. having a<br>
&gt; stippled line with pen &gt; 1 does slow down things
&gt; significantly. Moving<br> 
&gt; a miniwindow interactively is not smooth at all but distinctly<br>
&gt; "jumpy". It does seem to require a lot of processing power.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; MORAL: one should avoid stippled lines with pen &gt; 1. Having pen = 1<br>
&gt; does not seem to have any noticable performance impact on the graphic<br>
&gt; operations. Is this true in general, i.e. having pen &gt; 1 costs<br> 
&gt; a lot while pen = 1 does not have this cost (regardless of the texture)?
</b>

<p>XPCE's pen  1 is mapped onto X11's pen = 0, which implies `paint the
thinnest line and do it fast'.  X11's pen &gt;= 1 are supposed to paint
beautiful lines with optimal caps and joints.  They use floating-point
for doing the computations (at least 90% or so of the servers do). I
don't understand the `why' here as to my best knowledge there are quite
impressive bit-manipulation algorithms for this that gives results
which will be hard to distinguish from what X11 use and are probably
100 or more times faster.  XPCE paints shapes with pen &gt; 1 and texture
`none' by painting the same shape multiple times with pen 1 ...

Xfree 2.1 server used by Linux and most PC-based Unix systems.

&gt;  I traced it and I have noticed that the "@arg1?product_name == Name"<br>
&gt; condition always fails (after I've just created two objects with the<br>

<p>
The == object compares object *references*.  Either use the method
-&gt;equal (message(@arg1?product_name, equal, Name)) or use names instead
of string objects to represent the product name.  Names represent (like
strings) textual values, but it is guaranteed that iff two names
represent the same textual value they are the same object.
<p>
Considering memory: names are slightly more expensive to store due to
the table needed.  Uniqueness saves space if you have enough of the
same.  Names are (currently) not garbage collected.
<p>
Note that graphical objects have a name and you may want to use this
for storing the identification name.  In that case you can use the
device &lt;-member message to locate the object.

I think you should make sure the message of the text item succeeds, your
implementation of the thing only succeeds if there *is* as duplicate 
product object. This will do:
<xmp>
dup_prod(Product, Name) :->
	"check if this product has already been defined"::
         get(Product, canvas, C),     %C is a picture

The problem is actually with the (many) X window managers. They send

The simplest solution is to switch `frame <->confirm_done' to @off.
This will stop XPCE displaying the confirmer window.  You can do this
for all applications by adding a line:

Pce.Frame.confirm_done: @off

in your ~/.Xdefaults or the Pce resource file.

Not unreasonable.  By making a variable of type hash_table*, you don't
*create* a hash-table object, you just define this slot can contain one.
Check the definition of object -&gt;initialise and class <-instance for
details on object creation.
<p>
Normally your class looks like this:
<xmp>
...
variable(feedback_table, hash_table, both, "..").
..

initialise(R, ....) :->
	send(R, send_super, initialise, ...),
	send(R, feedback_table, new(hash_table)),
	....

</xmp>
Alternatively, you can use:
<xmp>
...
variable(feedback_table, hash_table*, both, "..").
...


blabla(R, .....) :->
	get(R, feedback_table, T),
	(   T == @nil
	->  send(R, feedback_table, new(T1, hash_table))
	;   T1 = T
	),
	send(T1, append, bla, gnat).

No short ones.  There is code using them in the libraries.  Just grep

<b>get(@finder, file, ...)</b> returns the *name* of a file. This is good
enough for methods that expect a file (type conversion will create
an instance of class file with this name, so you can say send(View,
load, 'myfile.pl')), but not good enough for just sending it an

In general, PostScript is supported for all real graphics classes, but

	   error. What does that mean?</h2></A>

<p><b>&gt; I get the message:</b>
<xmp>
> 
>   [WARNING: Out of lock stack]
> 
>   Execution Aborted
> 
>   23 ?-     
</xmp>

<p>This is generally another word for `Segmentation fault', occurring in
the lock-stack area.  I can't be of much help in trying to debug this.
What version of XPCE/SWI-Prolog are you running?  If older than 4.7.2
it may be wise to upgrade as some serious bugs have been patched in
this version.
<p>
When desparate and installed from the sources, you may try to replace
the message in outOf() in file pl-alloc.c by calling fatalError().  This
will cause an attempt to print the Prolog stacks, but in this case it is
very likely to run into a recursive error.  You can also contact the
process from gdb and break on outOf().  When trapped you can call
backTrace(environment_frame, 10) to get a Prolog backtrace.  When using
gdb, the symbol table should be xpce/pl/sparc-.../xpce.base.

<h1>Tricks and Hacks</h1>

<A NAME="testkeyrunning"><h2>Can I test a key while my
	   application is running?</h2></A>

<p><b>
&gt; is it possible in XPCE to test a key while <br>
&gt; the program is running ? <br>
&gt; I need this to STOP my program, when it gets into a cycle.</b>
<p>
Basically you can check for events using
<xmp>
	...,
	send(@display, synchronise),
	...,
</xmp>
So, if you want a button to stop your loop, do:
<xmp>
:- dynamic
	stopped/0.

test :-
	send(button(stop, and(message(@prolog, assert, stopped),
			      message(@receiver?frame, destroy))),
	     open),
	my_loop.
	
	my_loop :-
		send(@display, synchronise),
		retract(stopped), !.
	my_loop :-
		my_loop.		
</xmp>

<b>send(@display, synchronise)</b>, is not particulary fast (about 2000 calls
per second on a SPARC 10), so don't call it too often.
<p>
If we are talking about program development, you can normally type Control-C
to interrupt your program from a loop. This should work on all versions,
except for the MS-Windows versions that check explicitely for Control-C
at some central points in the code, but nevertheless can loop such that
it doesn't check.

<A NAME="alwaysfail"><h2>How can I implement an always failing
	   code object?</h2></A>

<p>There are many ways to define this code object. For example:
<center>
   <b>new(or)</b>
</center>
this one is the smallest, fastest and easiest to write.
<p>
It's not an hack, it's just logic:an or object can have any number of
statements, succeeds as soon as it executed one successfully and
fails otherwise.  If there is no statement, it fails.
<p>
So, how to create an object that always succeeds (no, I don't buy
not(new(or)), although it works :-)

<A NAME="poormouse"><h2>My mouse has only two buttons. Is
	   there a way to use XPCE for me?</h2></A> 
<p><b>
&gt; The major problem I have with the Windows port is that I don't<br>
&gt; have a 3-button mouse.  So I can't do anything with the dialog
editor!<br> 
&gt; Any suggestions (apart from "go and buy a 3-button mouse")?</b>

<p>For the time being this is about the best I can think of.  Mice are
rather cheap these days.
<p>
If you have 2 buttons, you might try the resources:
<xmp>
        Pce.PopupGesture.button:        left
        Pce.PopupGesture.modifier:      c
</xmp>
which, in theory would let you have the menu's using Control-left
button.  Bit annoying I guess, but better then nothing :-)
<p>
As long as the code doesn't explicitely assign buttons to gestures
you can play this trick with all of the gestures.

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<A NAME="aixondos"><h2>Is it really true that applications
	   developed on, let's say AIX, will run without modifications
	   on, e.g., DOS/Windows?</h2></A>  

<p>Yes, with the exception of minor things that cannot be emulated in a
sensible way.  For example class process (dealing with inferior
processes a la GNU-Emacs) is not available for the MS-Windows version.
Also, MS-Windows window-icons are 32x32 bits, while X11 window icons
are unlimited.  The MS-Windows version will scale the icon for you,
but whether it gets pretier this way ...

<A NAME="godsavethequeen"><h2>Why are recognizers spelt

<p>Because Jan Wielemaker still loves Good Ol' Britain (certainly more
than the Webster dictionary does).
