		  Documentation for the SGML2PL package

This directory contains the documentation for   the  sgml2pl package for
SWI-Prolog. The home of this package is

	http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/SWI-Prolog/packages/sgml2pl/

To build this documentation you  need   SWI-Prolog  installed as `pl' in
your path with the sgml package installed. In addition you need pdflatex
or latex.  Make targets:

	make [doc.pdf]		Make doc.pdf (requires pdflatex)
	make doc.ps		Make doc.ps (requires latex and dvips)
	make clean		Remove generated file except for targets
	make distclean		Remove all generated files

doc2tex.pl and xml_convert.pl contain the   sourcecode of the converter.
Especially  xml_convert.pl,  defining  xml_select/3    might   be  worth
considering.

If you have a recent version of XPCE, you can also type

	pl -f browse.pl
	?- x.

To see the documentation  rendered   through  XPCE's  document rendering
system.
