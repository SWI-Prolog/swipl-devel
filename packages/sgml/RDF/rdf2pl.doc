\begin{abstract}
RDF ({\bf R}esource {\bf D}escription {\bf F}ormat) is a W3C standard
for expressing meta-data about web-resources. It has three 
representations providing the same semantics. RDF documents are
normally transferred as XML documents using the RDF-XML syntax.  This
format is very unsuitable for processing.  The parser defined here
converts an RDF-XML document into the triple notation.

\section{Introduction}

RDF is a promising standard for representing meta-data about documents
on the web as well as exchanging ontologies. RDF is often associated
with `semantics on the web'. It consists of a formal data-model defined
in terms of \jargon{triples}. In addition, a \jargon{graph} model is
defined for visualisation and an XML application is defined for
exchange.

`Semantics on the web' is often associated with the Prolog programming
language. It is assumed that Prolog is a suitable vehicle to reason with
the data expressed in RDF models. Most of the related web-infra
structure (e.g. XML parsers, DOM implementations) are defined in Java,
Perl, C or C++.

Various routes are available to the Prolog user. Low-level XML parsing
is due to its nature best done in C or C++. These languages produce fast
code. As XML/SGML are the basis of most of the other web-related formats
we will benefit most here. XML and SGML being very stable specifications
make this even more attractive.

But what about RDF?  RDF-XML is defined in XML, and provided with a
Prolog term representing the XML document processing it according to
the RDF syntax is quick and easy in Prolog.  The alternative, getting
yet another library and language attached to the system, is getting
less attractive.


\section{Parsing RDF in Prolog}

To demonstrate this, we realised an RDF compiler in Prolog on top of
the sgml2pl package (providing a name-space sensitive XML parser).
The transformation is realised in two passes.

The first pass rewrites the XML term into a Prolog term conveying the
same information in a more friendly manner.  This transformation is
defined in a high-level pattern matching language defined on top of
Prolog with properties similar to DCG (Definite Clause Grammar).

The source of this translation is very close to the BNF notation used by
the \url[specification]{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/}, so
correctness is `obvious'. Below is a part of the definition of RDF
containers. Note that XML elements are represented using a term of the
format:

\begin{quote}
    \term{element}{Name, [AttrName = Value...], [Content ...]}
\end{quote}

\begin{code}
memberElt(LI) ::=
	\referencedItem(LI).
memberElt(LI) ::=
	\inlineItem(LI).

referencedItem(LI) ::=
	element(\rdf(li),
		[ \resourceAttr(LI) ],
		[]).

inlineItem(literal(LI)) ::=
	element(\rdf(li),
		[ \parseLiteral ],
		LI).
inlineItem(description(description, _, _, Properties)) ::=
	element(\rdf(li),
		[ \parseResource ],
		\propertyElts(Properties)).
inlineItem(LI) ::=
	element(\rdf(li),
		[],
		[\rdf_object(LI)]), !.	% inlined object
inlineItem(literal(LI)) ::=
	element(\rdf(li),
		[],
		[LI]).			% string value
\end{code}

Expression in the rule that are prefixed by the \verb$\$ operator acts
as invocation of another rule-set.  The body-term is converted into
a term where all rule-references are replaced by variables.  The
resulting term is matched and translation of the arguments is achieved
by calling the appropriate rule.  Below is the Prolog code for the
{\bf referencedItem} rule:

\begin{code}
referencedItem(A, element(B, [C], [])) :-
        rdf(li, B),
        resourceAttr(A, C).
\end{code}

Additional code can be added using a notation close to the Prolog
DCG notation.  Here is the rule for a description, producing
properties both using {\bf propAttrs} and {\bf propertyElts}.

\begin{code}
description(description, About, BagID, Properties) ::=
	element(\rdf('Description'),
		\attrs([ \?idAboutAttr(About),
			 \?bagIdAttr(BagID)
		       | \propAttrs(PropAttrs)
		       ]),
		\propertyElts(PropElts)),
	{ !, append(PropAttrs, PropElts, Properties)
	}.
\end{code}


\section{Predicates}

The parser is designed to operate on various environments and therefore
provides interfaces at various levels. First we describe the top level
defined in \pllib{rdf}, simply parsing a PDF-XML file into a list of
triples. Please note these are {\em not} asserted into the database
because it is not necessarily the final format the user wishes to reason
with and it is not clean how the user wants to deal with multiple RDF
documents.  Some options are using global URI's in one pool, in Prolog
modules or using an additional argument.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{load_rdf}{2}{+File, -Triples}
Same as \term{load_rdf}{File, Triples, []}.
    \predicate{load_rdf}{3}{+File, -Triples, +Options}
Read the RDF-XML file \arg{File} and return a list of \arg{Triples}.
\arg{Options} defines additional processing options.  Currently defined
options are:

   \begin{description}
	\termitem{base_uri}{BaseURI}
If provided local identifiers and identifier-references are globalised
using this URI.  If omited or the atom \verb$[]$, local identifiers are
not tagged.
   \end{description}

The \arg{Triples} list is a list of \term{rdf}{Subject, Predicate,
Object} triples.  \arg{Subject} is either a plain resource (an atom),
or one of the terms \term{each}{URI} or \term{prefix}{URI} with the
obvious meaning.  \arg{Predicate} is either a plain atom for
explicitely non-qualified names or a term 
\mbox{\arg{NameSpace}{\bf :}\arg{Name}}.  If \arg{NameSpace} is the
defined RDF name space it is returned as the atom \const{rdf}.
Finally, \arg{Object} is a URI, a \arg{Predicate} or a term of the
format \term{literal}{Value} for literal values.  \arg{Value} is
either a plain atom or a parsed XML term (list of atoms and elements).
\end{description}


\subsection{Name spaces}

XML name spaces are identified using a URI. Unfortunately various URI's
are in common use to refer to RDF. The \file{rdf_parser.pl} module
therefore defined the namespace as a multifile/1 predicate, that can be
extended by the user. For example, to parse the \url[Netscape
OpenDirectory]{http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/inference.html}
\file{structure.rdf} file, the following declarations are used:

\begin{code}
:- multifile
	rdf_parser:rdf_name_space/1.

rdf_parser:rdf_name_space('http://www.w3.org/TR/RDF/').
rdf_parser:rdf_name_space('http://directory.mozilla.org/rdf').
rdf_parser:rdf_name_space('http://dmoz.org/rdf').
\end{code}

The initial definition of this predicate is given below.

\begin{code}
rdf_name_space('http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#').
rdf_name_space('http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax').
\end{code}


\subsection{Low-level access}

The above defined load_rdf/[2,3] is not always suitable.  For example,
it cannot deal with documents where the RDF statement is embedded an
XML document. It also cannot deal with really big documents (e.g.\
the Netscape OpenDirectory project), without huge amounts of memory.

For really big documents, the {\bf sgml2pl} parser can be programmed
to handle the content of a specific element (i.e. \elem{rdf:RDF})
element-by-element.  The parsing primitives defined in this section
can be used to process these one-by-one.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{xml_to_rdf}{3}{+XML, +BaseURI, -Triples}
Process an XML term produced by load_structure/3 using the
\term{dialect}{xmlns} output option.  \arg{XML} is either
a complete \elem{rdf:RDF} element, a list of RDF-objects
(container or description) or a single description of container.
    \predicate{process_rdf}{3}{+File, +BaseURI, :OnTriples}
Exploits the call-back interface of {\bf sgml2pl}, calling
\arg{OnTriples} with the list of triples resulting from a single
top level RDF object for each RDF element in the file.  This predicate
can be used to process arbitrary large RDF files as the file is
processed object-by-object.  The example below simply asserts all
triples into the database:

\begin{code}
assert_list([]).
assert_list([H|T]) :-
	assert(H),
	assert_list(T).

?- process_rdf('structure,rdf', [], assert_list).
\end{code}
\end{description}

\section{Testing the RDF translator}

A test-suite and driver program are provided by \file{rdf_test.pl} in
the source directory. To run these tests, load this file into Prolog in
the distribution directory. The test files are in the directory
\file{suite} and the proper output in \file{suite/ok}. Predicates
provided by \file{rdf_test.pl}:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{suite}{1}{+N}
Run test \arg{N} using the file \file{suite/tN.rdf} and display the
RDF source, the intermediate Prolog representation and the resulting
triples.
    \predicate{passed}{1}{+N}
Process \file{suite/tN.rdf} and store the resulting triples in
\file{suite/ok/tN.pl} for later validation by test/0.
    \predicate{test}{0}{}
Run all tests and classify the result.
\end{description}

\section{Metrics}

It took three days to write and one to document the Prolog RDF parser.
A significant part of the time was spent understanding the RDF
specification.

The size of the source (including comments) is given in the table
below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|rrr|l|l|}
\hline
\bf lines & \bf words & \bf bytes & \bf file & \bf function \\
\hline
    109  &   255  &  2663 & rdf.pl        & Driver program \\
    312  &   649  &  6416 & rdf_parser.pl & 1-st phase parser \\
    246  &   752  &  5852 & rdf_triple.pl & 2-nd phase parser \\
    126  &   339  &  2596 & rewrite.pl    & rule-compiler \\
\hline
    793  &  1995  & 17527 & total & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


We also compared the performance using an RDF-Schema file generated by
\url[Protege-2000]{http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/protege/} and
interpreted as RDF. This file contains 162 descriptions in 50 Kbytes,
resulting in 599 triples.  Environment: Intel Pentium-II/450 with
384 Mbytes memory running SuSE Linux 6.3.

The parser described here requires 0.15 seconds excluding 0.13 seconds
Prolog startup time to process this file. The \url[Pro
Solutions]{http://www.pro-solutions.com/rdfdemo/} parser (written in
Perl) requires 1.5 seconds exluding 0.25 seconds startup time.


\section{Installation}

\subsection{Unix systems}

Installation on Unix system uses the commonly found {\em configure},
{\em make} and {\em make install} sequence. SWI-Prolog should be
installed before building this package. If SWI-Prolog is not installed
as \program{pl}, the environment variable \env{PL} must be set to the
name of the SWI-Prolog executable. Installation is now accomplished
using:

\begin{code}
% ./configure
% make
% make install
\end{code}

This installs the Prolog library files in \file{$PLBASE/library}, where
\file{$PLBASE} refers to the SWI-Prolog `home-directory'.

\subsection{Windows}

Copy the files \file{rdf.pl}, \file{rdf_parse.pl}, \file{rdf_triple.pl}
and \file{rewrite.pl} to the SWI-Prolog library, start Prolog and run
make/0 to update the library index.
