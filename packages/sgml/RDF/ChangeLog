  * Fixed exception in cleanup.  Dominique de Waleffe.

Feb 28, 2003

  * ADDED: Use BaseURI to create non-conflicting anonymous resources.

  * FIXED: rdf_parser:global_id to ignore xml:base for absolute URIs

Jan 17, 2003

  * FIXED: online.pl (web frontend) to avoid using goal/1 option for the
    xml parser.  Now uses 4.0.8 clib memfile library primitives.

  * FIXED: process_rdf/3, Peter Marks.

  * ADDED: parseType="Collection", satisfying the W3C Working Draft
    8 November 2002.

# Sumary of incompatibilities:
#
#	Many problems in nested bag handling, changing output of
#	suite/t5.rdf
#
#	Content of Alt-container was incorrectly rendered as rdf:li
#	instead of rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc (suite/t27.rdf).
################################################################
	
  * ADDED: Translate rdf:li predicates into _1, _2, etc.

  * FIXED: parseType=Literal to avoid extraneous [..] around the value

Oct 28, 2002

  * CLEANUP: pass base-uri as attribute, preparing for xml:base and making
    the parser ready for multi-threading.

Sep 16, 2002 

  * MODIFIED: Allow for unqualified attribute-names

  * ADDED: "make check"

Older entries

  * FIXED: Type-exception in atom_chars/2

  * FIXED: handling mixed <name>literal</name> and <name>object</name>
    (space canonisation problem).

  * CGI Demo: report errors generated before a fatal exception.

  * FIXED: handling of propertyElt of the form
    rdf:ID="myid" rdf:parseType="Resource" 

  * For objects, map NameSpace:Local to the simple concatenation of the two.
    This implies:

	# Subjects are always atoms
	# Predicates are NameSpace:LocalName or simply Name
	# Objects are atoms (URI) or literal(Value)

  * Warn on things that cannot be converted into an RDF-object rather then
    failing silently.

  * Removed some undesirable choice-points.
