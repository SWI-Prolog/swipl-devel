---+ SWI-Prolog Semantic Web Library

---++ Abstract

The semweb library provides a Prolog   library based on foreign-language
extensions for storing and manipulating RDF triples. It can handle quite
large sets of triples only  limited   by  available  memory. One million
triples requires about 80MB memory, so   a  fully equiped 32-bit machine
can handle about 25 million triples. A   64-bit machine with 32Gb memory
(just a few thousand euros in june 2009)   can  handle up to 150 million
triples.


---++ Prerequisites

This library depends on the RDF parser  library which in turn depends on
the XML parser provided by the sgml package.


---++ Further info

This library defines the semantic web infrastructure for SWI-Prolog. The
library is documented in semweb.pdf or   the  equivalent semweb.html. If
your  installation  does   not   include    this   file,   please  visit

---++ Staying up-to-date

This library is under active  development.   The  recent  version can be
accessed from the GIT repository under the directory pl/packages/semweb.
See http://www.swi-prolog.org/git.html for details on   the  central GIT
repository and instructions for browsing the repository online.
