\begin{abstract}
This document describes a library for dealing with standards from the
\url[W3C]{http://www.w3c.org/} standard for the \emph{Semantic Web}.
Like the standards themselves (RDF, RDFS and OWL) this infrastructure
is modular.  It consists of Prolog packages for reading, querying and
storing semantic web documents as well as XPCE libraries that provide
visualisation and editing.  The Prolog libraries can be used without
the XPCE GUI modules.  The library has been actively used with upto 10
million triples, using approximately 1GB of memory.  Its scalability
is limited by memory only.  The library can be used both on 32-bit 
and 64-bit platforms.

\section{Introduction}

SWI-Prolog has started support for web-documents with the development of
a small and fast SGML/XML parser, followed by an RDF parser (early
2000). With the \file{semweb} library we provide more high level support
for manipulating semantic web documents.  The semantic web is the likely
point of orientation for knowledge representation in the future, making
a library designed in its spirit promising.


\section{Modules}

Central to this library is the module \file{rdf_db.pl}, providing
storage and basic querying for RDF triples. This triple store is filled
using the RDF parser realised by \file{rdf.pl}. The storage module can
quickly save and load (partial) databases. The modules \file{rdfs.pl}
and \file{owl.pl} add querying in terms of the more powerful RDFS and
OWL languages. Module \file{rdf_edit.pl} adds editing, undo, journaling
and change-forwarding. Finally, a variety of XPCE modules visualise and
edit the database. Figure \figref{modules} summarised the modular
design.

\section{Module semweb/rdf_db}

The central module is called \file{rdf_db}.  It provides storage and
indexed querying of RDF triples.  Triples are stored as a quintuple.
The first three elements denote the RDF triple. \arg{File} and
\arg{Line} provide information about the origin of the triple.

\begin{quote}
\{\arg{Subject} \arg{Predicate} \arg{Object} \arg{File} \arg{Line}\}
\end{quote}

The actual storage is provided by the \jargon{foreign language (C)}
module \file{rdf_db.c}.  Using a dedicated C-based implementation we
can reduced memory usage and improve indexing capabilities.%
	\footnote{The orginal implementation was in Prolog.  This
		  version was implemented in 3 hours, where the C-based
		  implementation costed a full week.  The C-based
		  implementation requires about half the memory and
		  provides about twice the performance.}
Currently the following indexing is provided.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Any of the 3 fields of the triple
    \item \arg{Subject} + \arg{Predicate} and \arg{Predicate} + \arg{Object}
    \item \arg{Predicates} are indexed on the \jargon{highest property}.  In
          other words, if predicates are related through
	  \const{subPropertyOf} predicates indexing happens on the most
	  abstract predicate. This makes calls to rdf_has/4 very
	  efficient.
    \item String literal \arg{Objects} are indexed case-insensitive to make
          case-insensitive queries fully indexed. See rdf/3.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Query the RDF database}
\label{sec:rdfquery}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf}{3}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object}
Elementary query for triples. \arg{Subject} and \arg{Predicate} are
atoms representing the fully qualified URL of the resource. \arg{Object}
is either an atom representing a resource or \term{literal}{Value} if
the object is a literal value. If a value of the form
\infixterm{:}{NameSpaceID}{LocalName} is provided it is expanded to a
ground atom using expand_goal/2. This implies you can use this construct
in compiled code without paying a performance penalty. See also
\secref{rdfns}.  Literal values take one of the following forms:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{Atom}{}
If the value is a simple atom it is the textual representation of
a string literal without explicit type or language (\const{xml:lang})
qualifier.

    \termitem{lang}{LangID, Atom}
\arg{Atom} represents the text of a string literal qualified with
the given language.

    \termitem{type}{TypeID, Value}
Used for attributes qualified using the \const{rdf:datatype}
\arg{TypeID}. The \arg{Value} is either the textual representation or a
natural Prolog representation. See the option
\term{convert_typed_literal}{:Convertor} of the parser. The storage
layer provides efficient handling of atoms, integers (64-bit) and floats
(native C-doubles).  All other data is represented as a Prolog
record.
\end{description}

For string querying purposes, \arg{Object} can be of the form
\term{literal}{+Query, -Value}, where \arg{Query} is one of the
terms below.  Details of literal matching and indexing are described
in \secref{litindex}.

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{exact}{+Text}
    	    Perform exact, but case-insensitive match.  This query is
	    fully indexed.
	\termitem{substring}{+Text}
	    Match any literal that contains \arg{Text} as a case-insensitive
	    substring.  The query is not indexed on \arg{Object}.
	\termitem{word}{+Text}
	    Match any literal that contains \arg{Text} delimited by
	    a non alpha-numeric character, the start or end of the
	    string.  The query is not indexed on \arg{Object}.
	\termitem{prefix}{+Text}
	    Match any literal that starts with \arg{Text}.  This call
	    is intended for \jargon{completion}.  The query is not
	    indexed on \arg{Object}.
	\termitem{like}{+Pattern}
	    Match any literal that matches \arg{Pattern} case
	    insensitively, where the `*' character in \arg{Pattern}
	    matches zero or more characters.
    \end{description}

Backtracking never returns duplicate triples. Duplicates can be
retrieved using rdf/4. The predicate rdf/3 raises a type-error if called
with improper arguments. If rdf/3 is called with a term
\term{literal}{_} as \arg{Subject} or \arg{Predicate} object it fails
silently. This allows for graph matching goals like
\verb$rdf(S,P,O),rdf(O,P2,O2)$ to proceed without errors.%
	\footnote{Discussion in the SPARQL community votes for allowing
		  literal values as subject. Although we have no
		  principal objections, we fear such an extension will
		  promote poor modelling practice.}

    \predicate{rdf}{4}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object, ?Source}
As rdf/3 but in addition return the source-location of the triple.  The
source is either a plain atom or a term of the format
\infixterm{:}{Atom}{Integer} where \arg{Atom} is intended to be used as
filename or URL and \arg{Integer} for representing the line-number.
Unlike rdf/3, this predicate does not remove duplicates from the result
set.

    \predicate{rdf_has}{4}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object, -TriplePred}
This query exploits the RDFS \const{subPropertyOf} relation.  It 
returns any triple whose stored predicate equals \arg{Predicate} or
can reach this by following the recursive \arg{subPropertyOf} relation.
The actual stored predicate is returned in \arg{TriplePred}. The example
below gets all subclasses of an RDFS (or OWL) class, even if the
relation used is not \const{rdfs:subClassOf}, but a user-defined
sub-property thereof.%
	\footnote{This predicate realises semantics defined in
		  RDF-Schema rather than RDF.  It is part of the
		  \pllib{rdf_db} module because the indexing of
		  this module incorporates the  \const{rdfs:subClassOf}
		  predicate.}

\begin{code}
subclasses(Class, SubClasses) :-
	findall(S, rdf_has(S, rdfs:subClassOf, Class), SubClasses).
\end{code}

Note that rdf_has/4 and rdf_has/3 can return duplicate answers if
they use a different \arg{TriplePred}.

    \predicate{rdf_has}{3}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object}
Same as \term{rdf_has}{Subject, Predicate, Object, _}.

    \predicate{rdf_reachable}{3}{?Subject, +Predicate, ?Object}
Is true if \arg{Object} can be reached from \arg{Subject} following
the transitive predicate \arg{Predicate} or a sub-property thereof.
When used with either \arg{Subject} or \arg{Object} unbound, it first
returns the origin, followed by the reachable nodes in breath-first
search-order.  It never generates the same node twice and is robust
against cycles in the transitive relation. With all arguments
instantiated it succeeds deterministically of the relation if a
path can be found from \arg{Subject} to \arg{Object}.  Searching
starts at \arg{Subject}, assuming the branching factor is normally
lower.  A call with both \arg{Subject} and \arg{Object} unbound
raises an instantiation error.  The following example generates
all subclasses of \const{rdfs:Resource}:

\begin{code}
?- rdf_reachable(X, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:'Resource').

X = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource' ;

X = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class' ;

X = 'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property' ;

...
\end{code}

    \predicate{rdf_subject}{1}{?Subject}
Enumerate resources appearing as a subject in a triple.  The main reason
for this predicate is to generate the known subjects \emph{without
duplicates} as one gets using \term{rdf}{Subject, _, _}.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Literal matching and indexing}	\label{sec:litindex}

Starting with version 2.5.0 of this library, literal values are ordered
and indexed using a balanced binary tree (AVL tree).  The aim of this
index is threefold.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlike hash-tables, binary trees allow for efficient
	  \jargon{prefix} matching.  Prefix matching is very useful in
	  interactive applications to provide feedback while typing such
	  as auto-completion.

    \item Having a table of unique literals we generate creation and
	  destruction events (see rdf_monitor/2).  These events can
	  be used to maintain additional indexing on literals, such
	  as `by word'.
    
    \item A binary table allow for fast interval matching on typed
          numeric literals.\footnote{Not yet implemented}
\end{itemize}

As string literal matching is most frequently used for searching
purposes, the match is executed case-insensitive and after removal of
diacritics. Case matching and diacritics removal is based on Unicode
character properties and independent from the current locale. Case
conversion is based on the `simple uppercase mapping' defined by Unicode
and diacritic removal on the `decomposition type'. The approach is
lightweight, but somewhat simpleminded for some languages. The
tables are generated for Unicode characters upto 0x7fff.  For more
information, please check the source-code of the mapping-table generator
\file{unicode_map.pl} available in the sources of this package.

Currently the total order of literals is first based on the type of
literal using the ordering $$numeric < string < term$$ Numeric values
(integer and float) are ordered by value, integers preceed floats if
they represent the same value. strings are sorted alphabetically after
case-mapping and diacritic removal as described above. If they match
equal, uppercase preceeds lowercase and diacritics are ordered on their
unicode value.  If they still compare equal literals without any
qualifier preceeds literals with a type qualifier which preceeds
literals with a language qualifier.  Same qualifiers (both type or
both language) are sorted alphabetically.%
    \footnote{The ordering defined above may change in future versions
	      to deal with new queries for literals.}

The ordered tree is used for indexed execution of
\term{literal}{\term{prefix}{Prefix}, Literal} as well as
\term{literal}{\term{like}{Like}, Literal} if \arg{Like} does not start
with a `*'.  Note that results of queries that use the tree index
are returned in alphabetical order.


\subsection{Predicate properties}		\label{sec:predproperty}

The predicates below form an experimental interface to provide more
reasoning inside the kernel of the rdb_db engine. Note that
\const{symetric}, \const{inverse_of} and \const{transitive} are not yet
supported by the rest of the engine.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_current_predicate}{1}{?Predicate}
Enumerate all defined predicates.  Behaves as the code below, but
much more efficient.

\begin{code}
rdf_current_predicate(Predicate) :-
	findall(P, rdf(_,P,_), Ps),
	sort(Ps, S),
	member(Predicate, S).
\end{code}

    \predicate{rdf_set_predicate}{2}{+Predicate, +Property}
Define a property of the predicate.  Defined properties are listed
with rdf_predicate_property/2.

    \predicate{rdf_predicate_property}{2}{?Predicate, -Property}
Query properties of a defined predicate.  Currently defined properties
are given below.

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{symmetric}{Bool}
True if the predicate is defined to be symetric.  I.e.\ 
\mbox{\{A\} P \{B\}} implies \mbox{\{B\} P \{A\}}.

	\termitem{inverse_of}{Inverse}
True if this predicate is the inverse of \arg{Inverse}.

	\termitem{transitive}{Bool}
True if this predicate is transitive.

	\termitem{triples}{Triples}
Unify \arg{Triples} with the number of existing triples using
this predicate as second argument.  Reporting the number of 
triples is intended to support query optimization.

	\termitem{rdf_subject_branch_factor}{-Float}
Unify \arg{Float} with the average number of triples associated with
each unique value for the subject-side of this relation.  If there
are no triples the value 0.0 is returned.  This value is cached with
the predicate and recomputed only after substantial changes to the
triple set associated to this relation.  This property is indented
for path optimalisation when solving conjunctions of rdf/3 goals.

	\termitem{rdf_object_branch_factor}{-Float}
Unify \arg{Float} with the average number of triples associated with
each unique value for the object-side of this relation.  In addition
to the comments with the subject_branch_factor property, uniqueness
of the object value is computed from the hash key rather than the
actual values.

	\termitem{rdfs_subject_branch_factor}{-Float}
Same as \functor{rdf_subject_branch_factor}{1}, but also considering
triples of `subPropertyOf' this relation.  See also rdf_has/3.

	\termitem{rdfs_object_branch_factor}{-Float}
Same as \functor{rdf_object_branch_factor}{1}, but also considering
triples of `subPropertyOf' this relation. See also rdf_has/3.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


\subsection{Modifying the database}		\label{sec:rdfmodify}

As depicted in \figref{modules}, there are two levels of modification.
The \file{rdf_db} module simply modifies, where the \file{rdf_edit}
library provides transactions and undo on top of this.  Applications
that wish to use the \file{rdf_edit} layer must \emph{never} use the
predicates from this section directly.

\subsubsection{Modifying predicates}		\label{sec:modpreds}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_assert}{3}{+Subject, +Predicate, +Object}
Assert a new triple into the database. This is equivalent to
rdf_assert/4 using \arg{SourceRef} \const{user}. \arg{Subject} and
\arg{Predicate} are resources. \arg{Object} is either a resource or a
term \term{literal}{Value}. See rdf/3 for an explanation of \arg{Value}
for typed and language qualified literals. All arguments are subject to
name-space expansion (see \secref{rdfns}).

    \predicate{rdf_assert}{4}{+Subject, +Predicate, +Object, +SourceRef}
As rdf_assert/3, adding \arg{SourceRef} to specify the orgin of the
triple.  \arg{SourceRef} is either an atom or a term of the format
\arg{Atom}:\arg{Int} where \arg{Atom} normally refers to a filename
and \arg{Int} to the line-number where the description starts.

    \predicate{rdf_retractall}{3}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object}
Removes all matching triples from the database.  Previous Prolog
implementations also provided a backtracking \predref{rdf_retract}{3},
but this proved to be rarely used and could always be replaced with
rdf_retractall/3. As rdf_retractall/4 using an unbound \arg{SourceRef}.

    \predicate{rdf_retractall}{4}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object, ?SourceRef}
As rdf_retractall/4, also matching on the \arg{SourceRef}.  This is
particulary useful to update all triples coming from a loaded file.

    \predicate{rdf_update}{4}{+Subject, +Predicate, +Object, +Action}
Replaces one of the three fields on the matching triples depending
on \arg{Action}:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{subject}{Resource}
Changes the first field of the triple.
    \termitem{predicate}{Resource}
Changes the second field of the triple.
    \termitem{object}{Object}
Changes the last field of the triple to the given resource or
\term{literal}{Value}.
    \termitem{source}{Source}
Changes the source location (\jargon{payload}).  Note that updating the
source has no consequences for the semantics and therefore the
\jargon{generation} (see rdf_generation/1) is \emph{not} updated.
\end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_update}{5}{+Subject, +Predicate, +Object,
			      +Source,+Action}
As rdf_update/4 but allows for specifying the source.

\end{description}


\subsubsection{Transactions}			\label{transactions}

\index{transaction}%
The predicates from \secref{modpreds} perform immediate and atomic
modifications to the database. There are two cases where this is not
desirable:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
If the database is modified using information based on reading the same
database. A typical case is a forward reasoner examining the database
and asserting new triples that can be deduced from the already existing
ones.   For example, \emph{if $length(X) > 2$ then size(X) is large}:

\begin{code}
	(   rdf(X, length, literal(L)),
	    atom_number(L, IL),
	    IL > 2,
	    rdf_assert(X, size, large),
	    fail
	;   true
	).
\end{code}

Running this code without precautions causes an error because
rdf_assert/3 tries to get a write lock on the database which has
an a read operation (rdf/3 has choicepoints) in progress.

    \item
Multi-threaded access making multiple changes to the database that
must be handled as a unit.
\end{enumerate}

Where the second case is probably obvious, the first case is less so.
The storage layer may require reindexing after adding or deleting
triples. Such reindexing operatations however are not possible while
there are active read operations in other threads or from choicepoints
that can be in the same thread. For this reason we added
rdf_transaction/2. Note that, like the predicates from
\secref{modpreds}, rdf_transaction/2 raises a permission error exception
if the calling thread has active choicepoints on the database. The
problem is illustrated below.  The rdf/3 call leaves a choicepoint and
as the read lock originates from the calling thread itself the system
will deadlock if it would not generate an exception.

\begin{code}
1 ?- rdf_assert(a,b,c).
 
Yes
2 ?- rdf_assert(a,b,d).
 
Yes
3 ?- rdf(a,b,X), rdf_transaction(rdf_assert(a,b,e)).
ERROR: No permission to write rdf_db `default' (Operation would deadlock)
^  Exception: (8) rdf_db:rdf_transaction(rdf_assert(a, b, e)) ? no debug
4 ?-
\end{code}


\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_transaction}{1}{:Goal}
Same as \term{rdf_transaction}{Goal, \const{user}}.

    \predicate{rdf_transaction}{2}{:Goal, +Id}
After starting a transaction, all predicates from \secref{modpreds}
append their operation to the \emph{transaction} instead of modifying
the database. If \arg{Goal} succeeds rdf_transaction cuts all
choicepoints in \arg{Goal} and executes all recorded operations. If
\arg{Goal} fails or throws an exception, all recorded operations are
discarded and rdf_transaction/1 fails or re-throws the exception. 

On entry, rdf_transaction/1 gains exclusive access to the database, but
does allow readers to come in from all threads. After the successful
completion of \arg{Goal} rdf_transaction/1 gains completely exclusive
access while performing the database updates.

Transactions may be nested.  Committing a nested transactions merges
its change records into the outer transaction, while discarding a
nested transaction simply destroys the change records belonging to
the nested transaction.

The \arg{Id} argument may be used to identify the transaction.  It
is passed to the begin/end events posted to hooks registered with
rdf_monitor/2.
\end{description}


\subsection{Loading and saving to file}		\label{sec:rdffile}

The \file{rdf_db} module can read and write RDF-XML for import and
export as well as a binary format built for quick load and save
described in \secref{rdffastfile}.  Here are the predicates
for portable RDF load and save.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_load}{1}{+InOrList}
Load triples from \arg{In}, which is either a stream opened for reading,
an atom specifying a filename, a URL or a list of valid inputs. This
predicate calls process_rdf/3 to read the source one description at a
time, avoiding limits to the size of the input. By default, this
predicate provides for caching the results for quick-load using
rdf_load_db/1 described below.   Caching strategy and options are
description in \secref{rdfcache}.

    \predicate{rdf_load}{2}{+FileOrList, +Options}
As rdf_load/1, providing additional options.  The options are handed
to the RDF parser and implemented by process_rdf/3.  In addition, the
following options are provided:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{cache}{+Bool}
If \const{true} (default), try to use cached data or create a cache
file.  Otherwise load the source.

    \termitem{format}{+Format}
Specify the source format explicitly.  Normally this is deduced from
the filename extension or the mime-type.  The core library understands
the formats \const{xml} (RDF/XML) and \const{triples} (internal quick
load and cache format).

    \termitem{if}{+Condition}
Condition under which to load the source. \arg{Condition} is the same as
for the Prolog load_files/2 predicate: \const{changed} (default) load
the source if it was not loaded before or has changed; \const{true}
(re-)loads the source unconditionally and \const{not_loaded} loads the
source if it was not loaded, but does not check for modifications.

    \termitem{silent}{+Bool}
If \arg{Bool} is \const{true}, the message reporting completion is
printed using level \const{silent}. Otherwise the level is
\const{informational}.  See also print_message/2.
\end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_unload}{1}{+Spec}
Remove all triples loaded from \arg{Spec}. \arg{Spec} is either the name
of a loaded database (see rdf_source/1) or a file specification. If
\arg{Spec} does not refer to a loaded database the predicate succeeds
silently.

    \predicate{rdf_save}{1}{+File}
Save all known triples to the given \arg{File}.  Same as
\term{rdf_save}{File, []}.

    \predicate{rdf_save}{2}{+File, +Options}
Save with options.  Provided options are:

    \begin{description}
        \termitem{db}{+FileRef}
Save all triples whose file-part of their \arg{SourceRef} matches
\arg{FileRef} to the given \arg{File}.   Saving arbitrary selections
is possible using predicates from \secref{partsave}.

        \termitem{anon}{+Bool}
if \term{anon}{false} is provided anonymous resources are only saved
if the resource appears in the object field of another triple that is
saved.

	\termitem{base_uri}{+BaseURI}
If provided, emit \const{xml:base}="\arg{BaseURI}" in the header and
emit all URIs that are relative to the base-uri.  The \const{xml:base}
declaration can be suppressed using the option
\term{write_xml_base}{false}

	\termitem{write_xml_base}{+Bool}
If \const{false} (default \const{true}), do \emph{not} emit the
\const{xml:base} declaration from the given \const{base_uri} option.
The idea behind this option is to be able to create documents with
URIs relative to the document itself:

\begin{code}
	...,
	rdf_save(File,
 		 [ base_uri(BaseURI),
		   write_xml_base(false)
		 ]),
	...
\end{code}

	\termitem{convert_typed_literal}{:Converter}
If present, raw literal values are first passed to \arg{Converter} to
apply the reverse of the \const{convert_typed_literal} option of the
RDF parser.  The \arg{Converter} is called with the same arguments
as in the RDF parser, but now with the last argument instantiated
and the first two unbound.   A proper convertor that can be used for
both loading and saving must be a logical predicate.

	\termitem{encoding}{+Encoding}
Define the XML encoding used for the file.  Defined values are
\const{utf8} (default), \const{iso_latin_1} and \const{ascii}.
Using \const{iso_latin_1} or \const{ascii}, characters not covered by
the encoding are emitted as XML character entities (\verb$&#...;$).

	\termitem{document_language}{+XMLLang}
The value \arg{XMLLang} is used for the \const{xml:lang} attribute
in the outermost \const{rdf:RDF} element.  This language acts as
a default, which implies that the \const{xml:lang} tag is only used
for literals with a \emph{different} language identifier.  Please note
that this option will cause all literals without language tag to be
interpreted using \arg{XMLLang}.
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_source}{1}{?File}
Test or enumerate the sources known in the database. This is the
name-part of the 4-th argument of rdf/4.  If a file is loaded using
rdf_load/1, this is the name of the loaded file.

    \predicate{rdf_make}{0}{}
Re-load all RDF sourcefiles (see rdf_source/1) that have changed since
they were loaded the last time.  This implies all triples that originate
from the file are removed and the file is re-loaded.  If the file is
cached a new cache-file is written.  Please note that the new triples
are added at the end of the database, possibly changing the order of
(conflicting) triples.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Caching triples}
\label{sec:rdfcache}

The library \pllib{semweb/rdf_cache} defines the caching strategy for
triples sources. When using large RDF sources, caching triples greatly
speedup loading RDF documents. The cache library implements two caching
strategies that are controlled by rdf_set_cache_options/1.

\paragraph{Local caching} This approach applies to files only. Triples
are cached in a sub-directory of the directory holding the source.  This
directory is called \file{.cache} (\file{_cache} on Windows).  If the
cache option \const{create_local_directory} is \const{true}, a cache
directory is created if posible.

\paragraph{Global caching} This approach applies to all sources, except
for unnamed streams.  Triples are cached in directory defined by the
cache option \const{global_directory}.

When loading an RDF file, the system scans the configured cache files
unless \term{cache}{false} is specified as option to rdf_load/2 or
caching is disabled. If caching is enabled but no cache exists, the
system will try to create a cache file.  First it will try to do this
locally.  On failure it will try to configured global cache.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_set_cache_options}{1}{+Options}
Set cache options.  Defined options are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{enabled}{Bool}
If \const{true} (default), caching is enabled.

	\termitem{local_directory}{Atom}
Local directory to use for caching.  Default \const{.cache}
(Windows: \const{_cache}).

	\termitem{create_local_directory}{Bool}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), create a local cache
directory if none exists and the directory can be created.

	\termitem{global_directory}{Atom}
Must point to a writeable directory.  Sub-directories are created
to speedup indexing on filesystems that perform poorly on directories
with large numbers of files.  Initially not defined.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Partial save}			\label{sec:partsave}

Sometimes it is necessary to make more arbitrary selections of material
to be saved or exchange RDF descriptions over an open network link. The
predicates in this section provide for this.  Character encoding issues
are derived from the encoding of the \arg{Stream}, providing support for
\const{utf8}, \const{iso_latin_1} and \const{ascii}.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_save_header}{2}{+Stream, +Options}
Save an RDF header, with the XML header, \const{DOCTYPE},
\const{ENTITY} and opening the \const{rdf:RDF} element with appropriate
namespace declarations.  It uses the primitives from \secref{rdfns} to
generate the required namespaces and desired short-name.  \arg{Options}
is one of:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{db}{+FileRef}
    Only search for namespaces used in triples labeled with \arg{FileRef}.

	\termitem{namespaces}{+List}
    Where \arg{List} is a list of namespace abbreviations (see
    \secref{rdfns}).  With this option, the expensive search for
    all namespaces that may be used by your data is omitted.  The
    namespaces \const{rdf} and \const{rdfs} are added to the provided
    \arg{List}.  If a namespace is not declared, the resource is
    emitted in non-abreviated form.
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_save_footer}{1}{+Stream}
Close the work opened with rdf_save_header/2.

    \predicate{rdf_save_subject}{3}{+Stream, +Subject, +FileRef}
Save everything known about \arg{Subject} that matches \arg{FileRef}.
Using an variable for \arg{FileRef} saves all triples with
\arg{Subject}.

    \predicate{rdf_quote_uri}{2}{+URI, -Quoted}
Quote a UNICODE \arg{URI}.  First the Unicode is represented as UTF-8
and then the unsafe characters are mapped to %XX.  Quotes can always
be represented as US-ASCII.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Fast loading and saving}		\label{sec:rdffastfile}

Loading and saving RDF format is relatively slow.  For this reason we
designed a binary format that is more compact, avoids the complications
of the RDF parser and avoids repetitive lookup of (URL) identifiers.
Especially the speed improvement of about 25 times is worth-while when
loading large databases.  These predicates are used for caching by
rdf_load/[1,2] under certain conditions.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_save_db}{1}{+File}
Save all known triples into \arg{File}.  The saved version includes the
\arg{SourceRef} information.

    \predicate{rdf_save_db}{1}{+File, +FileRef}
Save all triples with \arg{SourceRef} \arg{FileRef}, regardless of the
line-number. For example, using \const{user} all information added
using rdf_assert/3 is stored in the database.

    \predicate{rdf_load_db}{1}{+File}
Load triples from \arg{File}.  
\end{description}


\subsubsection{MD5 digests}

The \file{rdf_db} library provides for \jargon{MD5 digests}. An MD5
digest is a 128 bit long hash key computed from the triples based on the
RFC-1321 standard.  MD5 keys are computed for each individual triple
and added together to compute the final key, resulting in a key that
describes the triple-set but is independant from the order in which
the triples appear.  It is claimed that it is practically impossible
for two different datasets to generate the same MD5 key.  The
Triple20 editor uses the MD5 key for detecting whether the triples
associated to a file have changed as well as to maintain a directory
with snapshots of versioned ontology files.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_md5}{2}{+Source, -MD5}
Return the MD5 digest for all triples in the database associated to
\arg{Source}. The \arg{MD5} digest itself is represented as an atom
holding a 32-character hexadecimal string.  The library maintains the
digest incrementally on rdf_load/[1,2], rdf_load_db/1, rdf_assert/[3,4]
and rdf_retractall/[3,4].  Checking whether the digest has changed since
the last rdf_load/[1,2] call provides a practical means for checking
whether the file needs to be saved.

    \predicate{rdf_atom_md5}{3}{+Text, +Times, -MD5}
Computes the MD5 hash from \arg{Text}, which is an atom, string or
list of character codes.  \arg{Times} is an integer $\geq 1$.  When
$> 0$, the MD5 algorithm is repeated \arg{Times} times on the
generated hash.  This can be used for password encryption algorithms
to make generate-and-test loops slow.

This predicate bears little relation to RDF handling. It is provided
because the RDF library already contains the MD5 algorithm and semantic
web services may involve security and consistency checking. This
predicate provides a platform independant alternative to the
\pllib{crypt} library provided with the \texttt{clib} package.
\end{description}


\subsection{Namespace Handling}			\label{sec:rdfns}

Prolog code often contains references to constant resources in a known
XML namespace. For example,
\const{http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema\#Class} refers to the most
general notion of a class. Readability and maintability concerns require
for abstraction here.  The dynamic and multifile predicate rdf_db:ns/2
maintains a mapping between short meaningful names and namespace
locations very much like the XML \const{xmlns} construct.  The initial
mapping contains the namespaces required for the semantic web languages
themselves:

\begin{code}
ns(rdf,  'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#').
ns(rdfs, 'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#').
ns(owl,  'http://www.w3.org/2002/7/owl#').
ns(xsd,  'http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#').
ns(dc,   'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/').
ns(eor,  'http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13/eor#').
\end{code}

All predicates for the semweb libraries use goal_expansion/2 rules to
make the SWI-Prolog compiler rewrite terms of the form
\infixterm{:}{Id}{Local} into the fully qualified URL.  In addition,
the following predicates are supplied:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_equal}{2}{Resource1, Resource2}
Defined as \infixterm{=}{Resource1}{Resource2}.  As this predicate is
subject to goal-expansion it can be used to obtain or test global URL
values to readable values. The following goal unifies \arg{X} with
\const{http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema\#Class} without more
runtime overhead than normal Prolog unification.

\begin{code}
	rdf_equal(rdfs:'Class', X)
\end{code}

    \predicate{rdf_register_ns}{2}{+Alias, +URL}
Same as \term{rdf_register_ns}{Alias, URL, []}.

    \predicate{rdf_register_ns}{2}{+Alias, +URL, +Options}
Register \arg{Alias} as a shorthand for \arg{URL}.  Note that the
registration must be done before loading any files using them as
namespace aliases are handled at compiletime through goal_expansion/2.
If \arg{Alias} already exists the default is to raise a permission
error.  If the option \term{force}{true} is provided, the alias is
silently modified.  Rebinding an alias must be done \emph{before} any
code is compiled that relies on the alias. If the option
\term{keep}{true} is provided the new registration is silently ignored.

    \predicate{rdf_global_id}{2}{?Alias:Local, ?Global}
Runtime translation between \arg{Alias} and \arg{Local} and a
\arg{Global} URL.  Expansion is normally done at compiletime.  This
predicate is often used to turn a global URL into a more readable
term.

    \predicate{rdf_global_object}{2}{?Object, ?NameExpandedObject}
As rdf_global_id/2, but also expands the type field if the object
is of the form \term{literal}{\term{type}{Type, Value}}.  This predicate
is used for goal expansion of the object fields in rdf/3 and similar
goals.

    \predicate{rdf_global_term}{2}{+Term0, -Term}
Expands all \arg{Alias}:\arg{Local} in \arg{Term0} and return the
result in \arg{Term}.  Use infrequently for runtime expansion of
namespace identifiers.

    \predicate{rdf_split_url}{3}{?Base, ?Local, ?URL}
Split a URL into a prefix and local part if used in mode -,-,+
or simply behave as atom_concat/3 in other modes.  The \arg{URL}
is split on the last \chr{\#} or \chr{/} character.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Namespace handling for custom predicates}

If we implement a new predicate based on one of the predicates of
the semweb libraries that expands namespaces, namespace expansion
is not automatically available to it.  Consider the following code
computing the number of distinct objects for a certain property
on a certain object.

\begin{code}
cardinality(S, P, C) :-
	(   setof(O, rdf_has(S, P, O), Os)
	->  length(Os, C)
	;   C = 0
	).
\end{code}

Now assume we want to write labels/2 that returns the number of
distict labels of a resource:

\begin{code}
labels(S, C) :-
	cardinality(S, rdfs:label, C).
\end{code}

This code will \emph{not work} as \verb$rdfs:label$ is not expanded
at compile time.  To make this work, we need to add an rdf_meta/1
declaration.

\begin{code}
:- rdf_meta
	cardinality(r,r,-).
\end{code}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_meta}{1}{Heads}
This predicate defines the argument types of the named predicates,
which will force compile time namespace expansion for these predicates.
\arg{Heads} is a coma-separated list of callable terms.  Defined
argument properties are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{:}{}
Argument is a goal. The goal is processed using expand_goal/2,
recursively applying goal transformation on the argument.
	\termitem{+}{}
The argument is instantiated at entry.  Nothing is changed.
	\termitem{-}{}
The argument is not instantiated at entry.  Nothing is changed.
	\termitem{?}{}
The argument is unbound or instantiated at entry.  Nothing is changed.
	\termitem{@}{}
The argument is not changed.
	\termitem{r}{}
The argument must be a resource.  If it is a term <namespace>:<local>
it is translated.
	\termitem{o}{}
The argument is an object or resource.
	\termitem{t}{}
The argument is a term that must be translated. Expansion will translate
all occurences of <namespace>:<local> appearing anywhere in the term.
    \end{description}

As it is subject to term_expansion/2, the rdf_meta/1 declaration can
only be used as a \emph{directive}. The directive must be processed
before the definition of the predicates as well as before compiling code
that uses the rdf meta-predicates. The atom \verb$rdf_meta$ is declared
as an operator exported from library \file{rdf_db.pl}. Files using
rdf_meta/1 \emph{must} explicitely load \file{rdf_db.pl}.

 Below are some examples from
\file{rdf_db.pl}

\begin{code}
:- rdf_meta
	rdf(r,r,o),
	rdf_source_location(r,-),
	rdf_transaction(:).
\end{code}
\end{description}


\subsection{Monitoring the database}		\label{sec:rdfmonitor}

Considering performance and modularity, we are working on a replacement
of the \file{rdf_edit} (see \secref{rdfedit}) layered design to deal
with updates, journalling, transactions, etc.  Where the rdf_edit
approach creates a single layer on top of rdf_db and code using the
RDF database must select whether to use rdf_db.pl or rdf_edit.pl, the
new approach allows to register \jargon{monitors}.  This allows multiple
modules to provide additional services, while these services will be
used regardless of how the database is modified.

Monitors are used by the persistency library (\secref{persistency})
and the literal indexing library (\secref{rdflitindex}).


\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_monitor}{2}{:Goal, +Mask}
\arg{Goal} is called for modifications of the database. It is called
with a single argument that describes the modification. Defined
events are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{assert}{+S, +P, +O, +DB}
A triple has been asserted.
    \termitem{retract}{+S, +P, +O, +DB}
A triple has been deleted.
    \termitem{update}{+S, +P, +O, +DB, +Action}
A triple has been updated.
    \termitem{new_literal}{+Literal}
A new literal has been created.  \arg{Literal} is the argument of 
\term{literal}{Arg} of the triple's object.  This event is introduced
in version 2.5.0 of this library.
    \termitem{old_literal}{+Literal}
The literal \arg{Literal} is no longer used by any triple. 
    \termitem{transaction}{+BeginOrEnd, +Id}
Mark begin or end of the \emph{commit} of a toplevel transaction started
by rdf_transaction/2. \arg{BeginOrEnd} is \const{begin} or \const{end}.
\arg{Id} is the second argument of rdf_transaction/2.  The following 
transaction Ids are pre-defined by the library:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{parse}{Id}
A file is loaded using rdf_load/2.  \arg{Id} is one of \term{file}{Path}
or \term{stream}{Stream}.
	\termitem{unload}{DB}
All triples with source \arg{DB} are being unloaded using rdf_unload/1.
	\termitem{reset}{}
Issued by rdf_reset_db/0.
    \end{description}

    \termitem{load}{+BeginOrEnd, +Spec}
Mark begin or end of rdf_load_db/1 or load through rdf_load/2 from
a cached file. \arg{Spec} is currently defined as \term{file}{Path}.
    \termitem{rehash}{+BeginOrEnd}
Marks begin/end of a re-hash due to required re-indexing or garbage
collection.
\end{description}

\arg{Mask} is a list of events this monitor is interested in. Default
(empty list) is to report all events. Otherwise each element is of the
form +Event or -Event to include or exclude monitoring for certain
events. The event-names are the functor names of the events described
above. The special name \const{all} refers to all events and
\term{assert}{load} to assert events originating from rdf_load_db/1. As
loading triples using rdf_load_db/1 is very fast, monitoring this at the
triple level may seriously harm performance.

This predicate is intended to maintain derived data, such as a journal,
information for \emph{undo}, additional indexing in literals, etc. There
is no way to remove registered monitors. If this is required one should
register a monitor that maintains a dynamic list of subscribers like the
XPCE broadcast library. A second subscription of the same hook predicate
only re-assignes the mask.

The monitor hooks are called in the order of registration and in the
same thread that issued the database manipulation. To process all
changes in one thread they should be send to a thread message queue. For
all updating events, the monitor is called while the calling thread has
a write lock on the RDF store. This implies that these events are
processed strickly synchronous, even if modifications originate from
multiple threads. In particular, the \const{transaction} \emph{begin},
\ldots{} \emph{updates} \ldots{} \emph{end} sequence is never
interleaved with other events. Same for \const{load} and \const{parse}.
\end{description}


\subsection{Miscellaneous predicates}

This section describes the remaining predicates of the \file{rdf_db}
module.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_node}{1}{-Id}
Generate a unique reference.  The returned atom is guaranteed not to
occur in the current database in any field of any triple.

    \predicate{rdf_bnode}{1}{-Id}
Generate a unique blank node reference. The returned atom is guaranteed
not to occur in the current database in any field of any triple and
starts with '__bnode'.

    \predicate{rdf_is_bnode}{1}{+Id}
Succeeds if \arg{Id} is a blank node identifier (also called
\jargon{anonymous resource}).  In the current implementation this
implies it is an atom starting with a double underscore.

    \predicate{rdf_source_location}{2}{+Subject, -SourceRef}
Return the source-location as \arg{File}:\arg{Line} of the first triple
that is about \arg{Subject}.

    \predicate{rdf_generation}{1}{-Generation}
Returns the \arg{Generation} of the database. Each modification to the
database increments the generation. It can be used to check the validity
of cached results deduced from the database. Modifications changing
multiple triples increment \arg{Generation} with the number of triples
modified, providing a heuristic for `how dirty' cached results may be.

    \predicate{rdf_estimate_complexity}{4}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object,
					   -Complexity}
Return the number of alternatives as indicated by the database 
internal hashed indexing.  This is a rough measure for the number
of alternatives we can expect for an rdf_has/3 call using the
given three arguments. When called with three variables, the total
number of triples is returned. This estimate is used in query
optimisation. See also rdf_predicate_property/2 and rdf_statistics/1 for
additional information to help optimisers.

    \predicate{rdf_statistics}{1}{?Statistics}
Report statistics collected by the \file{rdf_db} module.  Defined
values for \arg{Statistics} are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{lookup}{?Index, -Count}
Number of lookups using a pattern of instantiated fields.  \arg{Index}
is a term \term{rdf}{S,P,O}, where \arg{S}, \arg{P} and \arg{O} are
either \const{+} or \const{-}.  For example \term{rdf}{+,+,-} returns
the lookups with subject and predicate specified and object unbound.

	\termitem{properties}{-Count}
Number of unique values for the second field of the triple set.

	\termitem{sources}{-Count}
Number of files loaded through rdf_load/1.

	\termitem{subjects}{-Count}
Number of unique values for the first field of the triple set.

	\termitem{literals}{-Count}
Total number of unique literal values in the database.  See also
\secref{litindex}.

	\termitem{triples}{-Count}
Total number of triples in the database.

	\termitem{triples_by_file}{?File, -Count}
Enumerate the number of triples associated to each file.

	\termitem{searched_nodes}{-Count}
Number of nodes explored in rdf_reachable/3.

	\termitem{gc}{-Count, -Time}
Number of garbage collections and time spent in seconds represented as
a float.

	\termitem{rehash}{-Count, -Time}
Number of times the hash-tables were enlarged and time spent in seconds
represented as a float.

	\termitem{core}{-Bytes}
Core used by the triple store.  This includes all memory allocated on
behalf of the library, but \emph{not} the memory allocated in
Prolog atoms referenced (only) by the triple store.
    \end{description}
	
    \predicate{rdf_match_label}{3}{+Method, +Search, +Atom}
True if \arg{Search} matches \arg{Atom} as defined by \arg{Method}.
All matching is performed case-insensitive.  Defines methods are:
    \begin{description}
	\termitem{exact}{}
    	    Perform exact, but case-insensitive match.
	\termitem{substring}{}
	    \arg{Search} is a sub-string of \arg{Text}.
	\termitem{word}{}
	    \arg{Search} appears as a whole-word in \arg{Text}.
	\termitem{prefix}{}
	    \arg{Text} start with \arg{Search}.
	\termitem{like}{}
	    \arg{Text} matches \arg{Search}, case insensitively, where
	    the `*' character in \arg{Search} matches zero or more
	    characters.
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_reset_db}{0}{}
Erase all triples from the database and reset all counts and statistics
information.

    \predicate{rdf_version}{1}{-Version}
Unify \arg{Version} with the library version number.  This number is,
like to the SWI-Prolog version flag, defined as $10,000 \times
Major + 100 \times Minor + Patch$.
\end{description}


\subsection{Issues with rdf_db}				\label{sec:rdfissues}

This RDF low-level module has been created after two year experimenting
with a plain Prolog based module and a brief evaluation of a second
generation pure Prolog implementation. The aim was to be able to handle
upto about 5 million triples on standard (notebook) hardware and deal
efficiently with \const{subPropertyOf} which was identified as a crucial
feature of RDFS to realise fusion of different data-sets.

The following issues are identified and not solved in suitable manner.

\begin{description}
    \item [\const{subPropertyOf} of \const{subPropertyOf}] is not
supported.

    \item [Equivalence]
Similar to \const{subPropertyOf}, it is likely to be profitable to
handle resource identity efficient.  The current system has no support
for it.
\end{description}

		 %	     PLUGIN		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Plugin modules for rdf_db}
\label{sec:plugin}

The \pllib{rdf_db} module provides several hooks for extending its
functionality. Database updates can be monitored and acted upon through
the features described in \secref{rdfmonitor}. The predicate rdf_load/2
can be hooked to deal with different formats such as \jargon{turtle},
different input sources (e.g.\ http) and different strategies for
caching results.

\subsection{Hooks into the RDF library}
\label{sec:hooks}

The hooks below are used to add new RDF file formats and sources from
which to load data to the library. They are used by the modules
described below and distributed with the package.  Please examine the
source-code if you want to add new formats or locations.

\begin{description}
    \item[\file{rdf_turtle.pl}]
Load files in the Turtle format.  See \secref{turtle}.
    \item[\file{rdf_zlib_plugin.pl}]
Load \program{gzip} compressed files transparently.  See \secref{zlib}.
    \item[\file{rdf_http_plugin.pl}]
Load RDF documents from HTTP servers.  See \secref{http}.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_db:rdf_open_hook}{3}{+Input, -Stream, -Format}
Open an input. \arg{Input} is one of \term{file}{+Name},
\term{stream}{+Stream} or \term{url}{Protocol, URL}.  If this hook
succeeds, the RDF will be read from Stream using rdf_load_stream/3.
Otherwise the default open functionality for file and stream are
used.

    \predicate{rdf_db:rdf_load_stream}{3}{+Format, +Stream, +Options}
Actually load the RDF from \arg{Stream} into the RDF database.
\arg{Format} describes the format and is produced either by
rdf_input_info/3 or rdf_file_type/2.

    \predicate{rdf_db:rdf_input_info}{3}{+Input, -Modified, -Format}
Gather information on \arg{Input}. \arg{Modified} is the last
modification time of the source as a POSIX time-stamp (see time_file/2).
\arg{Format} is the RDF format of the file.  See rdf_file_type/2 for
details. It is allowed to leave the output variables unbound. Ultimately
the default modified time is `0' and the format is assumed to be
\const{xml}.

    \predicate{rdf_db:rdf_file_type}{2}{?Extension, ?Format}
True if \arg{Format} is the default RDF file format for files
with the given extension.  \arg{Extension} is lowercase and 
without a '.'.  E.g.\ \const{owl}.  \arg{Format} is either a
built-in format (\const{xml} or \const{triples}) or a format
understood by the rdf_load_stream/3 hook.

    \predicate{rdf_db:url_protocol}{1}{?Protocol}
True if \arg{Protocol} is a URL protocol recognised by rdf_load/2.
\end{description}


\subsection{Library semweb/rdf_zlib_plugin}
\label{sec:zlib}

\index{gz, format}\index{gzip}\index{compressed data}%
This module uses the \pllib{zlib} library to load compressed files
on the fly.  The extension of the file must be \fileext{gz}.  The
file format is deduced by the extension after stripping the \fileext{gz}
extension.  E.g.\ \exam{rdf_load('file.rdf.gz')}.


\subsection{Library semweb/rdf_http_plugin}
\label{sec:http}

\index{xhtml}%
This module allows for \exam{rdf_load('http://...')}. It exploits the
library \pllib{http/http_open.pl}. The format of the URL is determined
from the mime-type returned by the server if this is one of
\const{text/rdf+xml}, \const{application/x-turtle} or
\const{application/turtle}. As RDF mime-types are not yet widely
supported, the plugin uses the extension of the URL if the claimed
mime-type is not one of the above.  In addition, it recognises
\const{text/html} and \const{application/xhtml+xml}, scanning
the XML content for embedded RDF.

		 %	     LITINDEX		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Library semweb/rdf_litindex: Indexing words in literals}
\label{sec:rdflitindex}

The library \pllib{semweb/rdf_litindex.pl} exploits the primitives
of \secref{rdflitmap} and the NLP package to provide indexing on words
inside literal constants.  It also allows for fuzzy matching using
stemming and `sounds-like' based on the \jargon{double metaphone}
algorithm of the NLP package.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_find_literals}{2}{+Spec, -ListOfLiterals}
Find literals (without type or language specification) that satisfy
\arg{Spec}. The required indices are created as needed and kept
up-to-date using hooks registered with rdf_monitor/2.  Numerical
indexing is currently limited to integers in the range $\pm 2^30$
($\pm 2^62 on 64-bit platforms$).  \arg{Spec} is defined as:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{and}{Spec1, Spec2}
Intersection of both specifications.

	\termitem{or}{Spec1, Spec2}
Union of both specifications.

	\termitem{not}{Spec}
Negation of \arg{Spec}.  After translation of the full specification to
\jargon{Disjunctive Normal Form} (DNF), negations are only allowed
inside a conjunction with at least one positive literal.

	\termitem{case}{Word}
Matches all literals containing the word \arg{Word}, doing the match
case insensitive and after removing diacritics.

	\termitem{stem}{Like}
Matches all literals containing at least one word that has the same stem
as \arg{Like} using the Porter stem algorithm.  See NLP package for
details.

	\termitem{sounds}{Like}
Matches all literals containing at least one word that `sounds like'
\arg{Like} using the double metaphone algorithm.  See NLP package for
details.

	\termitem{prefix}{Prefix}
Matches all literals containing at least one word that starts with
Prefix, discarding diacritics and case.

	\termitem{between}{Low, High}
Matches all literals containing an integer token in the range
\arg{Low}..\arg{High}, including the boundaries.

	\termitem{ge}{Low}
Matches all literals containing an integer token with value
\arg{Low} or higher.

	\termitem{le}{High}
Matches all literals containing an integer token with value
\arg{High} or lower.

	\termitem{Token}{}
Matches all literals containing the given token.  See tokenize_atom/2
of the NLP package for details.
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_token_expansions}{2}{+Spec, -Expansions}
Uses the same database as rdf_find_literals/2 to find possible
expansions of \arg{Spec}, i.e.\ which words `sound like', `have prefix',
etc. \arg{Spec} is a compound expression as in rdf_find_literals/2.
\arg{Expansions} is unified to a list of terms \term{sounds}{Like,
Words}, \term{stem}{Like, Words} or \term{prefix}{Prefix, Words}. On
compound expressions, only combinations that provide literals are
returned.  Below is an example after loading the ULAN%
	\footnote{Unified List of Artist Names from the Getty
		  Foundation.}
database and showing all words that sounds like `rembrandt' and
appear together in a literal with the word `Rijn'.  Finding this
result from the 228,710 literals contained in ULAN requires 0.54
milliseconds (AMD 1600+).

\begin{code}
?- rdf_token_expansions(and('Rijn', sounds(rembrandt)), L).

L = [sounds(rembrandt, ['Rambrandt', 'Reimbrant', 'Rembradt',
			'Rembrand', 'Rembrandt', 'Rembrandtsz',
			'Rembrant', 'Rembrants', 'Rijmbrand'])]
\end{code}

Here is another example, illustrating handling of diacritics:

\begin{quote}\begin{alltt}
?- rdf_token_expansions(case(cafe), L).

L = [case(cafe, [cafe, caf\'e])]
\end{alltt}\end{quote}

    \predicate{rdf_tokenize_literal}{2}{+Literal, -Tokens}
Tokenize a literal, returning a list of atoms and integers in the range
$-1073741824 \ldots 1073741823$. As tokenization is in general domain
and task-dependent this predicate first calls the hook
\term{rdf_litindex:tokenization}{Literal, -Tokens}. On failure it
calls tokenize_atom/2 from the NLP package and deletes the following:
atoms of length 1, floats, integers that are out of range and the
english words \const{and}, \const{an}, \const{or}, \const{of},
\const{on}, \const{in}, \const{this} and \const{the}.  Deletion first
calls the hook \term{rdf_litindex:exclude_from_index}{token, X}.  This
hook is called as follows:

\begin{code}
no_index_token(X) :-
	exclude_from_index(token, X), !.
no_index_token(X) :-
	...
\end{code}
\end{description}

\subsection{Literal maps: Creating additional indices on literals}
\label{sec:rdflitmap}

`Literal maps' provide a relation between literal values, intended to
create additional indexes on literals. The current implementation can
only deal with integers and atoms (string literals). A literal map
maintains an ordered set of \jargon{keys}. The ordering uses the same
rules as described in \secref{litindex}. Each key is associated with an
ordered set of \jargon{values}. Literal map objects can be shared
between threads, using a locking strategy that allows for multiple
concurrent readers.

Typically, this module is used together with rdf_monitor/2 on the
channals \const{new_literal} and \const{old_literal} to maintain an
index of words that appear in a literal. Further abstraction using
Porter stemming or Metaphone can be used to create additional search
indices. These can map either directly to the literal values, or
indirectly to the plain word-map. The SWI-Prolog NLP package provides
complimentary building blocks, such as a tokenizer, Porter stem and
Double Metaphone.


\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_new_literal_map}{1}{-Map}
Create a new literal map, returning an opaque handle.

    \predicate{rdf_destroy_literal_map}{1}{+Map}
Destroy a literal map. After this call, further use of the \arg{Map}
handle  is illegal.  Additional synchronisation is needed if maps that
are shared between threads are destroyed to guarantee the handle is
no longer used.  In some scenarios rdf_reset_literal_map/1
provides a safe alternative.

    \predicate{rdf_reset_literal_map}{1}{+Map}
Delete all content from the literal map.  

    \predicate{rdf_insert_literal_map}{3}{+Map, +Key, +Value}
Add a relation between \arg{Key} and \arg{Value} to the map.  If
this relation already exists no action is performed.

    \predicate{rdf_delete_literal_map}{2}{+Map, +Key}
Delete \arg{Key} and all associated values from the map.  Succeeds
always.

    \predicate{rdf_delete_literal_map}{2}{+Map, +Key, +Value}
Delete the association between \arg{Key} and \arg{Value} from the map.
Succeeds always.

    \predicate{rdf_find_literal_map}{3}{+Map, +KeyList, -ValueList}
Unify \arg{ValueList} with an ordered set of values associated to
all keys from \arg{KeyList}.  I.e.\ perform an \jargon{intersection}
of the value-sets associated with the keys. Unifies \arg{ValueList}
with the empty list if no matches are found.

    \predicate{rdf_keys_in_literal_map}{3}{+Map, +Spec, -Answer}
Realises various queries on the key-set:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{all}{}
Unify \arg{Answer} with an ordered list of all keys.

	\termitem{key}{+Key}
Succeeds if \arg{Key} is a key in the map and unify \arg{Answer}
with the number of values associated with the key.  This provides
a fast test of existence without fetching the possibly large associated
value set as with rdf_find_literal_map/3.

	\termitem{prefix}{+Prefix}
Unify \arg{Answer} with an ordered set of all keys that have the
given prefix.  See \secref{rdfquery} for details on prefix matching.
\arg{Prefix} must be an atom. This call is intended for auto-completion
in user interfaces.

	\termitem{ge}{+Min}
Unify \arg{Answer} with all keys that are larger or equal to the 
integer \arg{Min}.

	\termitem{le}{+Max}
Unify \arg{Answer} with all keys that are smaller or equal to the 
integer \arg{Max}.


	\termitem{between}{+Min, +Max}
Unify \arg{Answer} with all keys between \arg{Min} and \arg{Max}
(including).
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_statistics_literal_map}{2}{+Map, +Key(-Arg...)}
Query some statistics of the map.  Provides keys are:
    \begin{description}
	\termitem{size}{-Keys, -Relations}
Unify \arg{Keys} with the total key-count of the index and
\arg{Relation} with the total \arg{Key}-\arg{Value} count.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		 %	    PERSISTENCY		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Module semweb/rdf_persistency}
\label{sec:persistency}

\index{Persistent store}% The \pllib{semweb/rdf_persistency} provides
reliable persistent storage for the RDF data. The store uses a directory
with files for each source (see rdf_source/1) present in the database.
Each source is represented by two files, one in binary format (see
rdf_save_db/2) representing the base state and one represented as Prolog
terms representing the changes made since the base state. The latter is
called the \jargon{journal}.


\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_attach_db}{2}{+Directory, +Options}
Attach \arg{Directory} as the persistent database. If \arg{Directory}
does not exist it is created. Otherwise all sources defined in the
directory are loaded into the RDF database. Loading a source means
loading the base state (if any) and replaying the journal (if any). The
current implementation does not synchronise triples that are in the
store before attaching a database. They are not removed from the
database, nor added to the presistent store. Different merging options
may be supported through the \arg{Options} argument later. \arg{Options}
is currently ignored. 

The database is locked against concurrent access using a file
\file{lock}. An attempt to attach a locked database raises a
\const{permission_error} exception.

    \predicate{rdf_detach_db}{0}{}
Detaches the persistent store.  No triples are removed from the RDF
triple store.

    \predicate{rdf_current_db}{1}{-Directory}
Unify \arg{Directory} with the current database directory.  Fails if no
persistent database is attached.

    \predicate{rdf_persistency}{2}{+DB, +Bool}
Change presistency of named database (4th argument of rdf/4). By default
all databases are presistent. Using \const{false}, the journal and
snapshot for the database are deleted and further changes to triples
associated with \arg{DB} are not recorded. If \arg{Bool} is \const{true}
a snapshot is created for the current state and further modifications
are monitored.  Switching persistency does not affect the triples in the
in-memory RDF database.

    \predicate{rdf_flush_journals}{1}{+Options}
Flush dirty journals.  With the option \term{min_size}{KB} only journals
larger than \arg{KB} Kbytes are merged with the base state.  Flushing a
journal takes the following steps, ensuring a stable state can be
recovered at any moment.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item	Save the current database in a new file using the
		extension \fileext{new}.
	\item	On success, delete the journal
	\item	On success, atomically move the \fileext{new} file
		over the base state.
    \end{enumerate}

Note that journals are \emph{not} merged automatically for two reasons.
First of all, some applications may decide never to merge as the journal
contains a complete \jargon{changelog} of the database.  Second, merging
large databases can be slow and the application may wish to schedule
such actions at quiet times or scheduled maintenance periods.
\end{description}

The above predicates suffice for most applications.  The predicates
below provide access to the journal files and the base state files
and are intented to provide additional services, such as reasoning 
about the journals, loaded files, etc.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_journal_file}{2}{?DB, ?JournalFile}
True if \arg{DB} is a known database that has an active journal in
\arg{JournalFile}.  Currently the format of the journalfiles is 
undocumented.  Being Prolog terms they are mostly self-explaining.

    \predicate{rdf_db_to_file}{2}{?DB, ?FileBase}
Convert between \arg{DB} (see rdf_source/1) and file base-file used
for storing information on this database.  The full file is located
in the directory described by rdf_current_db/1 and has the extension
\fileext{trp} for the base state and \fileext{jrn} for the journal.
\end{description}


		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		 %	      TURTLE		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Module semweb/rdf_turtle}
\label{sec:turtle}

\index{turtle}
The module \pllib{semweb/rdf_turtle} provides a parser for the
alternative RDF Turtle
syntax.\footnote{\url{http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/}}
The Turtle syntax is the basis for the SPARQL query language and much
easier to read and write by humans\footnote{And computers \ldots} than
the RDF/XML syntax.

This module acts as a \jargon{plugin} to \pllib{rdf_db.pl}, enabling
load_rdf/2 to load Turtle data transparently.  The default extension
for a turtle file is \fileext{ttl}.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdf_load_turtle}{3}{+Input, -Triples, +Options}
Parse Turtle data from Input, returning a list of \term{rdf}{S,P,O}
triples. Input is either a term \term{stream}{Stream} or a specification
for absolute_file_name/3.   Processed options are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{base_url}{+BaseURI}
Define the base URI.  When processing a file the default is constructed
from \const{file://} and the filename.

	\termitem{anon_prefix}{+Prefix}
Prefix used for blank notes.  Must start with \const{__}.  Default
is constructed from the base URI.
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdf_process_turtle}{3}{+Input, :OnTriples, +Options}
Similar to rdf_load_turtle/3, but processes the file in call-back mode.
See also process_rdf/3.  \arg{OnTriples} is called with two arguments.
The first argument is a non-empty list of triples and the second is
a term <DB>:<Line>, indicating the source location of the triples.
In addition to the options described with rdf_load_turtle/3 it accepts
the option \term{db}{DB}, specifying the named graph.  Default is the
base URI.
\end{description}

		 %	       RDFS		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Module semweb/rdfs}
\label{sec:rdfs}

\index{RDF-Schema}%
The \pllib{rdfs} library adds interpretation of the triple store in
terms of concepts from RDF-Schema (RDFS). There are two ways to provide
support for more high level languages in RDF.  One is to view such 
languages as a set of \jargon{entailment rules}.  In this model the
rdfs library would provide a predicate \predref{rdfs}{3} providing
the same functionality as rdf/3 on union of the raw graph and triples
that can be derived by applying the RDFS entailment rules.

Alternatively, RDFS provides a view on the RDF store in terms of
individuals, classes, properties, etc., and we can provide predicates
that query the database with this view in mind.  This is the approach
taken in the \pllib{rdfs.pl} library, providing calls like
\term{rdfs_individual_of}{?Resource, ?Class}.%
	\footnote{The SeRQL language is based on querying the deductive
		  closure of the triple set. The SWI-Prolog SeRQL
		  library provides \jargon{entailment modules} that
		  take the approach outlined above.}


\subsection{Hierarchy and class-individual relations}

The predicates in this section explore the \const{rdfs:subPropertyOf},
\const{rdfs:subClassOf} and \const{rdf:type} relations.  Note that the
most fundamental of these, \const{rdfs:subPropertyOf}, is also used 
by rdf_has/[3,4].

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfs_subproperty_of}{2}{?SubProperty, ?Property}
True if \arg{SubProperty} is equal to \arg{Property} or \arg{Property}
can be reached from \arg{SubProperty} following the
\const{rdfs:subPropertyOf} relation. It can be used to test as well as
generate sub-properties or super-properties. Note that the commonly used
semantics of this predicate is wired into rdf_has/[3,4].%
	\bug{The current implementation cannot deal with
	     cycles}.%
	\bug{The current implementation cannot deal with predicates
	     that are an \const{rdfs:subPropertyOf} of
	     \const{rdfs:subPropertyOf}, such as
	     \const{owl:samePropertyAs}.}

    \predicate{rdfs_subclass_of}{2}{?SubClass, ?Class}
True if \arg{SubClass} is equal to \arg{Class} or \arg{Class}
can be reached from \arg{SubClass} following the
\const{rdfs:subClassOf} relation. It can be used to test as
well as generate sub-classes or super-classes.%
	\bug{The current implementation cannot deal with
	     cycles}.

    \predicate{rdfs_class_property}{2}{+Class, ?Property}
True if the domain of \arg{Property} includes \arg{Class}.  Used to
generate all properties that apply to a class.

    \predicate{rdfs_individual_of}{2}{?Resource, ?Class}
True if \arg{Resource} is an indivisual of \arg{Class}.  This implies
\arg{Resource} has an \const{rdf:type} property that refers to
\arg{Class} or a sub-class thereof.  Can be used to test, generate
classes \arg{Resource} belongs to or generate individuals described
by \arg{Class}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Collections and Containers}

\index{parseType,Collection}%
\index{Collection,parseType}%
The RDF construct \const{rdf:parseType}=\const{Collection} constructs
a list using the \const{rdf:first} and \const{rdf:next} relations.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfs_member}{2}{?Resource, +Set}
Test or generate the members of \arg{Set}.  \arg{Set} is either an
individual of \const{rdf:List} or \const{rdf:Container}.

    \predicate{rdfs_list_to_prolog_list}{2}{+Set, -List}
Convert \arg{Set}, which must be an individual of \const{rdf:List} into
a Prolog list of objects.

    \predicate{rdfs_assert_list}{2}{+List, -Resource}
Equivalent to rdfs_assert_list/3 using \arg{DB} = \const{user}.

    \predicate{rdfs_assert_list}{3}{+List, -Resource, +DB}
If \arg{List} is a list of resources, create an RDF list \arg{Resource}
that reflects these resources.  \arg{Resource} and the sublist resources
are generated with rdf_bnode/1.  The new triples are associated with the
database \arg{DB}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Labels and textual search}

Textual search is partly handled by the predicates from the
\pllib{rdf_db} module and its underlying C-library.  For example,
literal objects are hashed case-insensitive to speed up the commonly
used case-insensitive search.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfs_label}{3}{?Resource, ?Language, ?Label}
Extract the label from \arg{Resource} or generate all resources with
the given \arg{Label}. The label is either associated using
a sub-property of \const{rdfs:label} or it is extracted from the URL
using rdf_split_url/3.  \arg{Language} is unified to the value of
the \const{xml:lang} attribute of the label or a variable if the
label has no language specified.

    \predicate{rdfs_label}{2}{?Resource, ?Label}
Defined as \term{rdfs_label}{Resource, _, Label}.

    \predicate{rdfs_ns_label}{3}{?Resource, ?Language, ?Label}
Similar to rdfs_label/2, but prefixes the result using the declared
namespace alias (see \secref{rdfns}) to facilitate user-friendly labels
in applications using multiple namespaces that may lead to confusion.

    \predicate{rdfs_ns_label}{2}{?Resource, ?Label}
Defined as \term{rdfs_ns_label}{Resource, _, Label}.

    \predicate{rdfs_find}{5}{+String, +Description, ?Properties, +Method, -Subject}
\index{search}%
Find (on backtracking) \arg{Subject}s that satisfy a search
specification for textual attributes.  \arg{String} is the string
searched for. \arg{Description} is an OWL description (see \secref{owl})
specifying candidate resources. \arg{Properties} is a list of properties
to search for literal objects, \arg{Method} defines the textual
matching algorithm.  All textual mapping is performed case-insensitive.
The matching-methods are described with rdf_match_label/3.  If
\arg{Properties} is unbound, the search is performed in any property and
\arg{Properties} is unified with a list holding the property on which
the match was found.
\end{description}


		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		 %	       OWL		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{OWL}				\label{sec:owl}

\index{OWL}%
The current SemWeb library distributed with SWI-Prolog does not yet
contain an OWL module.  A module \file{owl.pl} is part of the
\url[Triple20]{http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/Triple20/}
triple browser and editor provides limited support for OWL
reasoning.



		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		 %	     RDF-EDIT		%
		 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Module semweb/rdf_edit}			\label{sec:rdfedit}

\begin{quote}\em
It is anticipated that this library will eventually be superseeded by
facilities running on top of the native rdf_transaction/2 and
rdf_monitor/2 facilities. See \secref{rdfmonitor}.
\end{quote}

\index{undo}\index{journal}\index{transactions}
The module \file{rdf_edit.pl} is a layer than encasulates the
modification predicates from \secref{rdfmodify} for use from
a (graphical) editor of the triple store.  It adds the
following features:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Transaction management]
Modifications are grouped into \emph{transactions} to safeguard
the system from failing operations as well as provide meaningfull
chunks for undo and journalling.

    \item [Undo]
Undo and redo-transactions using a single mechanism to support
user-friendly editing.

    \item [Journalling]
Record all actions to support analysis, versioning, crash-recovery
and an alternative to saving.
\end{itemlist}

\subsection{Transaction management}

Transactions group low-level modification actions together.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfe_transaction}{1}{:Goal}
Run \arg{Goal}, recording all modifications to the triple store made
through \secref{rdfeencap}.  Execution is performed as in once/1.  If
\arg{Goal} succeeds the changes are committed.  If \arg{Goal} fails 
or throws an exception the changes are reverted.

Transactions may be nested.  A failing nested transaction only reverts
the actions performed inside the nested transaction.  If the outer
transaction succeeds it is committed normally.  Contrary, if the
outer transaction fails, comitted nested transactions are reverted
as well.  If any of the modifications inside the transaction modifies
a protected file (see rdfe_set_file_property/2) the transaction is
reverted and rdfe_transaction/1 throws a permission error.

A successful outer transaction (`level-0') may be undone using
rdfe_undo/0.

    \predicate{rdfe_transaction}{2}{:Goal, +Name}
As rdfe_transaction/1, naming the transaction \arg{Name}.  Transaction
naming is intended for the GUI to give the user an idea of the next undo
action. See also rdfe_set_transaction_name/1 and
rdfe_transaction_name/2.

    \predicate{rdfe_set_transaction_name}{1}{+Name}
Set the `name' of the current transaction to \arg{Name}.

    \predicate{rdfe_transaction_name}{2}{?TID, ?Name}
Query assigned transaction names.

    \predicate{rdfe_transaction_member}{2}{+TID, -Action}
Enumerate the actions that took place inside a transaction.  This can
be used by a GUI to optimise the MVC (Model-View-Controller) feedback
loop.  \arg{Action} is one of:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{assert}{Subject, Predicate, Object}
    \termitem{retract}{Subject, Predicate, Object}
    \termitem{update}{Subject, Predicate, Object, Action}
    \termitem{file}{load(Path)}
    \termitem{file}{unload(Path)}
\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{File management}			\label{sec:file}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfe_is_modified}{1}{?File}
Enumerate/test whether \arg{File} is modified sinds it was loaded or
sinds the last call to rdfe_clear_modified/1.  Whether or not a file
is modified is determined by the MD5 checksum of all triples belonging
to the file.

    \predicate{rdfe_clear_modified}{1}{+File}
Set the \emph{unmodified-MD5} to the current MD5 checksum.  See also
rdfe_is_modified/1.

    \predicate{rdfe_set_file_property}{2}{+File, +Property}
Control access right and default destination of new triples.
\arg{Property} is one of

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{access}{+Access}
    Where access is one of \const{ro} or \const{rw}.  Access \const{ro}
    is default when a file is loaded for which the user has no write
    access.  If a transaction (see rdfe_transaction/1) modifies a file
    with access \const{ro} the transaction is reversed.

	\termitem{default}{+Default}
    Set this file to be the default destination of triples.  If
    \arg{Default} is \const{fallback} it is only the default for
    triples that have no clear default destination. If it is \const{all}
    all new triples are added to this file.
    \end{description}

    \predicate{rdfe_get_file_property}{2}{?File, ?Property}
Query properties set with rdfe_set_file_property/2.
\end{description}


\subsection{Encapsulated predicates}		\label{sec:rdfeencap}

The following predicates encapsulate predicates from the \file{rdf_db}
module that modify the triple store. These predicates can only be called
when inside a \emph{transaction}.  See rdfe_transaction/1.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfe_assert}{3}{+Subject, +Predicate, +Object}
Encapsulates rdf_assert/3.
    \predicate{rdfe_retractall}{3}{?Subject, ?Predicate, ?Object}
Encapsulates rdf_retractall/3.
    \predicate{rdfe_update}{4}{+Subject, +Predicate, +Object, +Action}
Encapsulates rdf_update/4.
    \predicate{rdfe_load}{1}{+In}
Encapsulates rdf_load/1.
    \predicate{rdfe_unload}{1}{+In}
Encapsulates rdf_unload/1.
\end{description}

\subsection{High-level modification predicates}	\label{sec:rdfeedit}

This section describes a (yet very incomplete) set of more high-level
operations one would like to be able to perform.  Eventually this set
may include operations based on RDFS and OWL.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfe_delete}{1}{+Resource}
Delete all traces of \arg{resource}.  This implies all triples where
\arg{Resource} appears as \emph{subject}, \emph{predicate} or
\emph{object}.  This predicate starts a transation.
\end{description}

\subsection{Undo}

\index{undo}%
Undo aims at user-level undo operations from a (graphical) editor.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfe_undo}{0}{}
Revert the last outermost (`level 0') transaction (see
rdfe_transaction/1). Successive calls go further back in history. Fails
if there is no more undo information.

    \predicate{rdfe_redo}{0}{}
Revert the last rdfe_undo/0.  Successive calls revert more rdfe_undo/0
operations.   Fails if there is no more redo information.

    \predicate{rdfe_can_undo}{1}{-TID}
Test if there is another transaction that can be reverted.  Used for
activating menus in a graphical environment.  \arg{TID} is unified to
the transaction id of the action that will be reverted.

    \predicate{rdfe_can_redo}{1}{-TID}
Test if there is another undo that can be reverted.  Used for
activating menus in a graphical environment.  \arg{TID} is unified to
the transaction id of the action that will be reverted.
\end{description}

\subsection{Journalling}

\index{journal}%
Optionally, every action through this module is immediately send to a
\jargon{journal-file}. The journal provides a full log of all actions
with a time-stamp that may be used for inspection of behaviour, version
management, crash-recovery or an alternative to regular save operations.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{rdfe_open_journal}{2}{+File, +Mode}
Open a existing or new journal.  If \arg{Mode} equala \const{append}
and \arg{File} exists, the journal is first replayed. See
rdfe_replay_journal/1.  If \arg{Mode} is \const{write} the journal is
truncated if it exists.

    \predicate{rdfe_close_journal}{0}{}
Close the currently open journal.

    \predicate{rdfe_current_journal}{1}{-Path}
Test whether there is a journal and to which file the actions are
journalled.

    \predicate{rdfe_replay_journal}{1}{+File}
Read a journal, replaying all actions in it.  To do so, the system
reads the journal a transaction at a time.  If the transaction is
closed with a \emph{commit} it executes the actions inside the journal.
If it is closed with a \emph{rollback} or not closed at all due to a
crash the actions inside the journal are discarded.  Using this
predicate only makes sense to inspect the state at the end of a journal
without modifying the journal.  Normally a journal is replayed using the
\const{append} mode of rdfe_open_journal/2.
\end{description}


\subsection{Broadcasting change events}

\index{event}\index{broadcast}%
To realise a modular graphical interface for editing the triple store,
the system must use some sort of \emph{event} mechanism. This is
implemented by the XPCE library \pllib{broadcast} which is described
in the \url[XPCE User
Guide]{http://hcs.science.uva.nl/projects/xpce/UserGuide/libbroadcast.html}.
In this section we describe the terms brodcasted by the library.

    \termitem{rdf_transaction}{+Id}
A `level-0' transaction has been committed. The system passes the
identifier of the transaction in \arg{Id}. In the current implementation
there is no way to find out what happened inside the transaction.  This
is likely to change in time.

If a transaction is reverted due to failure or exception \emph{no} event
is broadcasted.  The initiating GUI element is supposed to handle this
possibility itself and other components are not affected as the triple
store is not changed.

    \termitem{rdf_undo}{+Type, +Id}
This event is broadcasted after an rdfe_undo/0 or rdfe_redo/0.
\arg{Type} is one of \const{undo} or \const{redo} and \arg{Id}
identifies the transaction as above.

\section{Related packages and issues}

\index{Sesame}\index{SeRQL}%
The SWI-Prolog SemWeb package is designed to provide access to the
Semantic Web languages from Prolog.  It consists of the low level
\file{rdf_db.pl} store with layers such as \file{rdfs.pl} to provide
more high level querying of a triple set with relations such as
rdfs_individual_of/2, rdfs_subclass_of/2, etc.
\url[SeRQL]{http://www.openrdf.org} is a semantic web query language
taking another route.  Instead of providing alternative relations
SeRQL defines a graph query on de \jargon{deductive closure} of the
triple set.  For example, under assumption of RDFS entailment rules
this makes the query \term{rdf}{S, rdf:type, Class} equivalent to
\term{rdfs_individual_of}{S, Class}.

\index{optimising,query}%
We developed a parser for SeRQL which compiles SeRQL path expressions
into Prolog conjunctions of \term{rdf}{Subject, Predicate, Object}
calls. \jargon{Entailment modules} realise a fully logical
implementation of rdf/3 including the entailment reasoning required to
deal with a Semantic Web language or application specific reasoning. The
infra structure is completed with a query optimiser and an HTTP server
compliant to the \url[Sesame]{http://www.openrdf.org} implementation of
the SeRQL language.  The Sesame Java client can be used to access Prolog
servers from Java, while the Prolog client can be used to access the
Sesame SeRQL server.  For further details, see the
