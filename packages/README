The package directory  contains  a   subdirectory  for  each  SWI-Prolog
package. Without packages, SWI-Prolog is called SWI-Prolog/lite.

Building
--------

To build these packages, first build  and install SWI-Prolog itself This
creates Makefile, copying some of the   configuration  settings from the
SWI-Prolog configuration options.

Now edit the PKG variable  in  Makefile   to  reflect  the  packages and
options preferred. If you install XPCE  (strongly recommended for better
online help, graphical  tracer,  integrated   editor  and  powerful  GUI
toolkit), make sure to have  the   following  installed  in a searchable
place:

	* libjpeg  (http://www.ijg.org/)
	* libXPM   (http://www-sop.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html)
	* The X11 development headers and libraries

Here are the required packages on   some package-based installations. In
general, you need the X  development  package.   libjpeg  is  often in a
separate package. Recent X development packages contain the Xpm library.
In older versions this is often a  separate package If your distribution
contains a development package for one of these libraries, use this.

Please contribute this information for  your   distribution  by  mail to
