The package directory  contains  a   subdirectory  for  each  SWI-Prolog
package. Without packages, SWI-Prolog is called SWI-Prolog/lite.

Building
--------

To build these packages, first build  and install SWI-Prolog itself This
creates Makefile, copying some of the   configuration  settings from the
SWI-Prolog configuration options.

Now edit the PKG variable  in  Makefile   to  reflect  the  packages and
options preferred. If you install XPCE  (strongly recommended for better
online help, graphical  tracer,  integrated   editor  and  powerful  GUI
toolkit), make sture to have  the   following  installed in a searchable
place:

	* libjpeg  (http://www.ijg.org/)
	* libXPM   (http://www-sop.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html)
	* The X11 development headers and libraries

Now run

	./configure
	./make
	./make install

And   optional   one   of   the   HTML     or   PDF   documentation   in
$(PLBASE)/doc/packages using:

	./make html-install
	./make pdf-install
