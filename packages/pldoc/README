		    PlDOc --- SWI-Prolog source documentation

Author: Jan Wiemaker

Status
------

Approach has been discussed with two external Prolog developers.

Code is very imcomplete.  Development plan:

---++ SWI-Prolog hooks

	* Needs to be documented (hackers corner)

---++ Wiki processor

Making solid progress.  remaining issues:

	* Tables in lists
	* Paragraphs in list-items
	* Complete tag processing
		- Combining multiple tags

---++ HTML generation

	* Generate structure for the file/module
	* PRE: expand tabs

---++ After Compilation with library(pldoc) loaded:

	* pldoc_comment(PredInd, -Comment).
	  pldoc_comment(module(Module), -Comment).

	  Comment is original string

	* Add \comment{Comment} to html generator?

	* Can be combined with XREF info and/or normal meta-info
	
	* Gathering can also be hooked into XREF by loading pldoc
	  and xref. [OK]

---++ Link to help/apropos

	* Would also link to PceEmacs!
	* Requires summary processing

---++ Summary extraction

	* Extract first sentence from description. [OK]	

---++ Quality assurance: comment style-check

	* Verify modes with first term (same name/arity)
	* Verify summary (length)
	* Verify required tags (notable param)
	* Verify declared @param exists

---++ Source processing

	* Synchronise source processing between. library(prolog_source). [OK]
		- XREF
		- PceEmacs
		- PlDoc
