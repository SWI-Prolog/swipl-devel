\begin{abstract}
This document describes the SWI-Prolog SSL library, a set of predicates
which provides secure sockets to Prolog applications, for example to run
a secure HTTPS server, or access websites using the \const{https}
protocol.  It can also be used to provide authentication and secure
data exchange between Prolog processes over the network.

\section{Introduction}

Raw TCP/IP networking is dangerous for two reasons.  It is hard to tell
whether the body you think you are talking to is indeed the right one and
anyone with access to a subnet through which your data flows can `tap'
the wire and listen for sensitive information such as passwords,
creditcard numbers, etc.   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) deals with both
problems.  It uses certificates to establish the identity of the peer
and encryption to make it useless to tap into the wire.  SSL allows
agents to talk in private and create secure web services.

The SWI-Prolog \pllib{ssl} library provides an API very similar to
\pllib{socket} for raw TCP/IP connections that provides SSL server
and client sockets.


\section{About SSL}

The SWI-Prolog SSL interface is built on top of the
\url[OpenSSL]{http://www.openssl.org/} library. This library is commonly
provided as a standard package in many Linux distributions. The
MS-Windows version is built using a binary distribution available from
\url{http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html}.

A good introduction on key- and certificate handling for OpenSSL can be
found at \url{http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/}


\section{Overview of the Prolog API}

An SSL server and client can be built with the following (abstracted)
predicate calls:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
    SSL server	      &	SSL client \\
\hline
    ssl_context/3     &	ssl_context/3 \\
    tcp_socket/1      &	tcp_socket/1 \\
    tcp_accept/3      &	tcp_connect/2 \\
    tcp_open_socket/3 &	tcp_open_socket/3 \\
    ssl_negotiatate/5 &	ssl_negotiate/5 \\
    \ldots	      &	\ldots \\
    ssl_exit/1	      &	ssl_exit/1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The library is abstracted to communication over streams, and is not
reliant on those streams being directly attached to sockets. The tcp_\ldots
calls here are simply the most common way to use the library. In UNIX, pipes
could just as easily be used, for example.

What follows is a description of each of these functions and the
arguments they accept.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{ssl_context}{3}{+Role, +Options, -SSL}
Role with legal values \const{server} or \const{client} denotes
whether the SSL instance will have a server or client role in the
established connection. With \arg{Options} various properties of the
SSL session can be defined, some of which required, some optional.
An overview is given below. The handle of the connection is returned
in \arg{SSL}.

Below is an overview of the \arg{Options} argument.  Some options are only
required by the client (C), some are required by the server (marked S),
some by both server as client (marked CS).

\begin{description}
    \termitem{host}{+HostName} [C]
        The host to connect to by the client or identified by the server.
        Both IP addresses and hostnames can be supplied here. This option
        is required for the client and optionally for the server.
    \termitem{port}{+Integer} [CS]
        The port to connect or listen to. This option is required since
        no default port can sensibly be defined for an abstract layer.
	The webserver \jargon{https} protocol uses port 443.
    \termitem{certificate_file}{+FileName} [S]
        Specify where the certificate file can be found. This can be the
        same as the key file (see next option).
    \termitem{key_file}{+FileName} [S]
        Specify where the private key can be found. This can be the same
        as the certificate file.
    \termitem{password}{+Text}
        Specify the password the private key is protected with (if any).
	If you do not want to store the password you can also specify
	an application defined handler to return the password
	(see next option).
    \termitem{pem_password_hook}{:PredicateName}
        In case a password is required to access the private key the
        supplied function will be called to fetch it. The function
        has the following prototype: \term{function}{+SSL, -Password}
    \termitem{cacert_file}{+FileName}
        Specify a file containing certificate keys which will thus
        automatically be verified as trusted. You can also install
        an application defined handler to verify certificates (see
        next option).
    \termitem{cert_verify_hook}{:PredicateName}
        In case a certificate cannot be verified or has some properties
        which makes it invalid (invalid validity date for example) the
        supplied function will be called to ask its opinion about the
        certificate. The predicate is called as follows:
	\term{function}{+SSL, +Certificate, +Error}.  Access will be
	granted iff the predicate succeeds.
    \termitem{cert}{+Boolean}
        Trigger the sending of our certificate as specified using
        the option \const{certificate_file} described earlier. For a
        server this option is automatically turned on.
    \termitem{peer_cert}{+Boolean}
        Trigger the request of our peer's certificate while establishing
        the SSL layer. This option is automatically turned on in a client
	SSL socket.
\end{description}

    \predicate{ssl_negotiate}{5}{+SSL, +PlainRead, +PlainWrite, -SSLRead, -SSLWrite}
Once a connection is established and a read/write stream pair is available,
(\arg{PlainRead} and \arg{PlainWrite}), this predicate can be called to
negotiate an SSL session over the streams. If the negotiation is successful,
 \arg{SSLRead} and \arg{SSLWrite} are returned.

    \predicate{ssl_exit}{1}{+SSL}
Clean up all resources related to the SSLinstance.
\end{description}

\section{Backward compatibility}

There are some predicates included to provide an API similar to the one
exposed by a previous version of the library.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{ssl_init}{3}{-SSL, +Role, +Options}
Analogous to ssl_context/3.

    \predicate{ssl_accept}{3}{+SSL, -Socket, -Peer}
Blocks until a connection is made to the host on the port specified by
the SSL object. \arg{Socket} and \arg{Peer} are then returned.

    \predicate{ssl_open/3}{3}{+SSL, -Read, -Write} (Client)
Connect to the host and port specified by the SSL object, negotiate an
SSL connection and return Read and Write streams if successful

    \predicate{ssl_open/4}{3}{+SSL, +Socket -Read, -Write} (Server)
Given the \arg{Socket} returned from \predicate{ssl_accept/3}, negotiate
the connection on the accepted socket and return Read and Write streams
if successful.
\end{description}


\section{Using SSL to provide HTTPS}

This packages installs the library \pllib{http/http_ssl_plugin.pl}
alongside the http package. This library is a plugin for
\pllib{http/thread_httpd.pl} that makes the threaded HTTP server support
HTTPS, which is simply HTTP over an SSL socket.  The HTTP server is
started in HTTPS mode by adding an option \const{ssl} to http_server/2.
The argument of the \const{ssl} option is an option list passed to
ssl_init/3. Here is an example that uses the demo certificates
distributed with the SSL package.

\begin{code}
https_server(Port, Options) :-
        http_server(reply,
                    [ port(Port),
                      timeout(60),
                      ssl([ host('localhost'),
                            cacert_file('etc/demoCA/cacert.pem'),
                            certificate_file('etc/server/server-cert.pem'),
                            key_file('etc/server/server-key.pem'),
                            password('apenoot1')
                          ])
                    | Options
                    ]).
\end{code}


\section{Example code}
\label{sec:examples}

Examples of a simple server and client (\file{server.pl} and
\file{client.pl} as well as a simple HTTPS server (\file{https.pl}) can
be found in the example directory which is located in
\file{doc/packages/examples/ssl} relative to the SWI-Prolog installation
directory. The \file{etc} directory contains example certificate files
as well as a \file{README} on the creation of certificates using OpenSSL
tools.


\section{Installation}

The OpenSSL libraries are \emph{not} part of the SWI-Prolog distribution
and on systems using packagers with dependency checking, dependency on
OpenSSL is deliberatly avoided. This implies that OpenSSL must be
installed seperatly before using SSL with a binary distribution of
SWI-Prolog. Most modern Linux distributions have an SSL package. An
installer for MS-Windows is available from
\url{http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html} The SWI-Prolog
SSL interface is currently built using OpenSSL 0.97b.

When installing from the source, the package configuration
automatically builds the ssl library if a suitable OpenSSL
implementation is found.  On Windows systems, OpenSSL must be
installed prior to building SWI-Prolog and \file{rules.mk} must
be edited to reflect the position of the header and libraries if
they are not in the standard search path.
