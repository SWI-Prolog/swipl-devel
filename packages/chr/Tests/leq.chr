:- module(leq,[leq/0]).
:- use_module(library(chr)).

:- constraints leq/2.

reflexivity  @ leq(X,X) <=> true.
antisymmetry @ leq(X,Y), leq(Y,X) <=> X = Y.
idempotence  @ leq(X,Y) \ leq(X,Y) <=> true.
transitivity @ leq(X,Y), leq(Y,Z) ==> leq(X,Z).

leq :-
	circle(X, Y, Z),
	\+ attvar(X),
	X == Y,
	Y == Z.

circle(X, Y, Z) :-
	leq(X, Y),
	leq(Y, Z),
	leq(Z, X).
