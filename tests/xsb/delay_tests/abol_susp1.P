% Tests abolishing suspensions and early completion.  The idea is that
% negation suspensions should not be abolished and early completion 
% cannot be performed when only unconditional answers are derived.
%
% In this program all answers are conditional; furthermore, no
% simplification is applicable and thus the residual program is
% identical to those without the writelns.  Nice example for
% displaying conditional answers...
