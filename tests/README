These directories contain tests called from   the main test-script. Each
subdirectory holds test-files. Each test file   must  obey the following
rules:

	* The filename must be unique in the whole test-pool

	* It must be a module-file and the module name must be the
	  filename

	* It must export a single predicate whose name is the name of
	  the file and the predicate should succeed without output if
	  the test succeeds.
