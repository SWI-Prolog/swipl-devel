DOCUMENTATION
=============

Documentation is available  on-line  using   the  help/1  and  apropos/1
commands. HTML and PDF versions of  the   manual  are available from the
SWI-Prolog download page. The add-on  packages   are  documented  in the
doc/packages directory of the installed system.  Many people opt for the
online manual at the address below.  This manual includes autocompletion
to simplify searching:

If you cannot reach the internet you   can  install the website locally.
The website source is in the git plweb.git:

	% git clone git://www.swi-prolog.org/home/pl/git/plweb.git

The web-server software is SWI-Prolog itself  (this requires many of the
default packages installed). After downloading do:

	% cd plweb
	% swipl -s load.pl
	?- server.

This starts the server at its default port: 3040.
