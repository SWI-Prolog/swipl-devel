DIRECTORIES

The SWI-Prolog source tree consists of the following directories:

./src		C sources
./src/gnu	GNU-Emacs unexec() sources (MODIFIED VERSION)
./boot		Prolog system predicates defined in Prolog
./library	Prolog user's library
./include	Include files.  Mostly for handling foreign-code
./man		Manual (LaTeX)
./lisp		GNU-Emacs Lisp sources for a better Prolog-mode
./dld-3.2	Wilson Ho's `dynamic link editor' (SUN and VAX only)
		(MODIFIED VERSION)


BUILDING SWI-Prolog

First,  make a  directory for  the  specified machine  using the SETUP
script.  The argument to SETUP describes the machine you  are running.
This machine is described in the file src/md-MACHINE.h.  To get a list
of architectures run SETUP without arguments.

Next, edit config.h:

M_SYSTEMHOME	absolute path pointing to this directory
M_DEFSTARTUP	Personal startup file basename
M_BINDIR	Installation directory for executables
M_PROLOG	Name of the resulting program

Next:
	1) cd ./MACHINE
	2) make

INSTALLATION:

	1) cd ./MACHINE
	2) make install

CLEANUP

	1) cd ./MACHINE
	2) make clean

GCC

When available,   please use the GNU-C  compiler  gcc.  SWI-Prolog has
been developed  with this compiler.    Donot use version  2.0, as this
compiler crashes on  pl-wam.c.  Version  2.1 is ok.   SWI-Prolog makes
use  of  GCC-2's  facilities to deal  with  label addresses, improving
performance with about 10%.


GNU-EMACS INTERFACE

In the directory ./lisp, you'll find  an interface to  GNU-EMACS.  The
file README.SWI provides installation directives.  In  consists of the
Quintus  Prolog  gnu-emacs  interface    with   an   additional   file
swi-prolog.el that redefines and adds some things.


NOTES

SunOs 3.x

Ancient users  of  SunOs  3.x  should  set  the  corresponding  flag  in
md-sun3.h. Dynamic stacks are not provided under SunOs 3.x.


DLD (Dynamic Link Editor)

The current distribution entails  a  limited interface to Wilson  Ho's
dynamic link editor for C called dld.   Dld can be loaded via Prolog's
own foreign interface and can be used to link C-packages.  Notably, it
is used to connect X-PCE; the X-window version of  the object oriented
user interface   toolkit   PCE.    See  also    ./library/dld.pl   and
./library/dld.c.

Dld is a library.  It is installed as follows:

	% cd dld
	% make install

Which    creates    /usr/lib/libdld.a,     /usr/man/man3/dld.3     and
/usr/include/dld.h (you must be super-user to do this installation).


PORTING/CHANGING SWI-PROLOG

Below  are some  notes meant for  those who decide  to modify  or port
SWI-Prolog.  It is by no means complete.


CODE USED ATOMS OR FUNCTORS

Atoms needed by the  C sources are addressed using  macros of the form
ATOM_<name>.  Functors  have the  form FUNCTOR_<name><arity>.  See the
file ATOMS.  The awk script defatoms is  invoked by make to create the
necessary C source and header files.  These files are named *.i[ch].

DEBUGGING SWI-Prolog ON A NEW MACHINE

1. Machine Description file.

Create a md- file for the new architecture.  You can use a  similar  one
as  starting  point and look at md-gener.h for a full description of the
options.  For the first port, I advice to set the following flags to 0:

	- O_ASM_SWITCH
	- O_FOREIGN
	- O_PCE
	- O_STORE_PROGRAM
	- O_SHARED_MEMORY
	- O_CAN_MAP

During debugging, make sure to give -g and -DO_DEBUG to the C  compiler,
so  you can debug the resulting prolog system using the -d level option.
-DO_DEBUG also includes some consistency checks.  For final installation
use -O and drop -DO_DEBUG (which makes the system about 20% slower).

If you are very lucky the system will compile and perform the  bootstrap
compilation  in one go.  Normally you are not.  On how to get it through
the C compiler, you are on your own.  If the system does not want to  do
the  bootstrap  compilation,  write  a  small prolog program that can be
handled by the bootstrap compiler and work on that.  Normally, I use

:- write('Hello World!').
:- nl.

You can compile this using `pl -d level -b file'.  If this finally writes
`Hello World' on your terminal you are getting close.  Next test program
can be:

test :-
	write('Hello World'),
	nl.

$init :-
	test,
	halt.

If you can compile this and you can run the result by typing `a.out'  or
`pl  -x  a.out  -d level' you can try to do the entire boot compilation.
If you decide to write more elaborate test programs you  should  realise
many  things  are  not  yet  defined.   Initially  you can only call the
foreign language predicates, defined in pl-ext.c. Constructs handles  by
the compiler (,/2, !, ->/2, ;/2, etc.)  cannot be called via metacall or
directives (but can be used in program text).

MODIFYING SWI-Prolog

You are free to modify SWI-Prolog under the licence terms  specified  in
the  file  LICENCE.   You  may  wish  the  other  users  can  share your
improvements.   For  code  to  be  accepted  as  part  of  the  official
distribution,  it should be written in the same style as the rest of the
SWI-Prolog sources.  I do not claim this style to be the best available,
but I want the  entire  source  to  have  a  consistent  style.   Please
document  the  modifications  and  if  reasonably possible indicate them
using #if ... #endif.  Please do not send `diff' files to me, I probably
do not have the same version of the sources, so complete files, with the
changes indicated with #if ... #endif are easier to incorporate.

If your change is accepted, you will be  appropriately  acknowledged  in
the distribution.

PROLOG PROGRAMS

Additions to the library and other stand alone Prolog programs have less
strick conditions.  Add comments such that other  users  can  understand
the  program  or  library module and ensure the files provide sufficient
documentation on its origin, waranty and distribution conditions.   Such
contributions are copied verbatim and not maintained by me.
