\libdoc{debug}{Some reusable code to help debugging applications}

This library provides an structured alternative for putting
print-statements into your source-code to trace what is going on. Debug
messages are organised in \jargon{topics} that can be activated and
de-activated without changing the source.  In addition, if the
application is compiled with the \cmdlineoption{-O} flag these
predicates are removed using goal_expansion/2.

Although this library can be used through the normal demand-loading
mechanism it is adviced to load it explicitely before code using it to
profit from goal-expansion, which removes these calls if compiled with
optimisation on and records the topics from debug/3 and debugging/1 for
list_debug_topics/0.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{debug}{3}{+Topic, +Format, +Args}
If \arg{Topic} is a selected debugging topic (see debug/1) a message
is printed using print_message/2 with level \const{informational}.
\arg{Format} and \arg{Args} are interpreted by format/2.  Here is a
typical example:

\begin{code}
	...,
	debug(init, 'Initialised ~w', [Module]),
	...,
\end{code}

\arg{Topic} can be any Prolog term.  Compound terms can be used to
make categories of topics that can be activated using debug/1.

    \predicate{debugging}{1}{+Topic}
Succeeds if \arg{Topic} is a selected debugging topic.  It is intended
to execute arbitrary code depending on the users debug topic selection.
The construct \mbox{\tt (debugging(Topic) -> \arg{Code} ; true)} is
removed if the code is compiled in optimise mode.

    \predicate{debug}{1}{+Topic}
Select all registered topics that unify with \arg{Topic} for debugging.
This call is normally used from the toplevel to activate a topic for
debugging.  Topics are de-activated using nodebug/1.

    \predicate{nodebug}{1}{+Topic}
Deactivates topics for debugging.  See debug/1 for the arguments.

    \predicate{list_debug_topics}{0}{}
List the current status of registered topics.  See also debugging/0.

    \predicate{assume}{1}{:Goal}
\index{assertions}%
This predicate is to be compared to the C-library assert()
function. By inserting this goal you explicitely state you expect
\arg{Goal} to succeed at this place. As assume/1 calls are removed when
compiling in optimized mode \arg{Goal} should not have side-effects.
Typical examples are type-tests and validating invariants defined by
your application.

If \arg{Goal} fails the system prints a message and starts the debugger.
