\libdoc{prologxref}{Cross-reference data collection library}
\label{sec:lib:prologxref}

This library collects information on defined and used objects in Prolog
sourcefiles. Typically these are predicates, but we expect the library
to deal with other types of objects in the future. The library is a
building block for tools doing dependency tracking in applications.
Dependency tracking is useful to reveal the structure of an unknown
program or detect missing components at compile-time, but also for
program transformation or minimising a program saved-state by only
saving the reachable objects.

This section gives a partial description of the library API, providing
some insight in how you can use it for analysing your program.  The
library should be further modularized, moving its knowledge about
-for example- XPCE into a different file and allowing for adding
knowledge about other libraries such as Logtalk.  \textbf{Please do not
consider this interface rock-solid.}

The library is exploited by two graphical tools in the SWI-Prolog
environment. The XPCE frontend started by gxref/0 and described in
\secref{xref} and PceEmacs (\secref{pceemacs}) which exploits this
library for its syntax colouring.

For all predicates described below, \arg{Source} is the source that is
processed.  This is normally a filename in any notation acceptable to
the file loading predicates (see load_files/2).  Using the hooks defined
in \secref{xrefhooks} it can be anything else that can be translated
into a Prolog stream holding Prolog source text.  \arg{Callable} is
a callable term (see callable/1).  Callables do not carry a module
qualifier unless the referred predicate is not in the module defined
\arg{Source}.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{xref_source}{1}{+Source}
Gather information on \arg{Source}. If \arg{Source} has already been
processed and is still up-to-date according to the file timestamp, no
action is taken. This predicate must be called on a file before
information can be gathered.

    \predicate{xref_current_source}{1}{?Source}
\arg{Source} has been processed.

    \predicate{xref_clean}{1}{+Source}
Remove the information gathered for \arg{Source}

    \predicate{xref_defined}{3}{?Source, ?Callable, -How}
\arg{Callable} is defined in \arg{Source}.  \arg{How} is one of
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\term{dynamic}{}    		& Declared dynamic \\
\term{thread_local}{}    	& Declared thread local \\
\term{multifile}{}    		& Declared multifile \\
\term{local}{Line}    		& First clause at Line \\
\term{foreign}{Line}  		& Foreign library loaded a Line \\
\term{constraint}{Line}		& CHR Constraint at Line \\
\term{imported}{File}		& Imported from \arg{File} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

    \predicate{xref_called}{3}{?Source, ?Callable, ?By}
\arg{Callable} is called in \arg{Source} by \arg{By}.

    \predicate{xref_exported}{2}{?Source, ?Callable}
\arg{Callable} is public (exported from the module).

    \predicate{xref_module}{2}{?Source, ?Module}
\arg{Source} is a module-file defining the given module.

    \predicate{xref_built_in}{1}{?Callable}
True if \arg{Callable} is a built-in predicate. Currently this is
assumed for all predicates defined in the \const{system} module and
having the property \const{built_in}.  Built-in predicates are not
registered as `called'.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Extending the library}

The library provides hooks for extending its rules it uses for finding
predicates called by some programming construct.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{prolog:called_by}{2}{+Goal, -Called}
Where \arg{Goal} is a non-var subgoal appearing in called object
(typically a clause-body). If it succeeds it must return a list of goals
called by \arg{Goal}. As a special construct, if a term $Callable+N$ is
returned, $N$ variable arguments are added to \arg{Callable} before
further processing. For simple meta-calls a single fact suffices.
Complex rules as used in the \pllib{html_write} library provided by the
HTTP package examine the arguments and create a list of called objects.

The current system cannot deal with the same name/arity in different
modules that behave differently with respect to called arguments.
