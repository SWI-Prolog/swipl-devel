\chapter{The SWI-Prolog library}		\label{sec:libpl}

This chapter documents the SWI-Prolog library.  As SWI-Prolog provides
auto-loading, there is little difference between library predicates
and built-in predicates.  Part of the library is therefore documented
in the rest of the manual.  Library predicates differ from built-in
predicates in the following ways.

\begin{itemize}
    \item User-definition of a built-in leads to a permission-error,
          while using the name of a library predicate is allowed.

    \item If autoloading is disabled explicitely or because trapping
          unknown predicates is disabled (see unknown/2 and
          current_prolog_flag/2), library predicates must be loaded
	  explicitely.

    \item Using libraries reduce the footprint of applications that
          don't need them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}\em
The documentation of the library is just started. Material from the
standard packages should be moved here, some material from other parts
of the manual should be moved too and various libraries are not
documented at all.
