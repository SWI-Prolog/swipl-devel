\noindent
Elements of an association list have 2 components: A (unique)
\emph{key} and a \emph{value}. Keys should be ground, values need not
be. An association list can be used to fetch elements via their keys
and to enumerate its elements in ascending order of their keys. The
\pllib{assoc} module uses AVL trees to implement association
lists. This makes inserting, changing and fetching a single element an
O(log(N)) (where N denotes the number of elements in the list)
expected time (and worst-case time) operation.

\begin{description}
	\predicate{assoc_to_list}{2}{+Assoc, -List}
		\arg{List} is a list of Key-Value pairs corresponding to
		the associations in \arg{Assoc} in ascending order of keys.

	\predicate{empty_assoc}{1}{-Assoc}
		\arg{Assoc} is unified with an empty association list.

	\predicate{gen_assoc}{3}{?Key, +Assoc, ?Value}
		Enumerate matching elements of \arg{Assoc} in
		ascending order of their keys via backtracking.

	\predicate{get_assoc}{3}{+Key, +Assoc, ?Value}
		\arg{Value} is the value associated with \arg{Key} in the
		association list \arg{Assoc}.

	\predicate{get_assoc}{5}{+Key, +Assoc, ?Old, ?NewAssoc, ?New}
		\arg{NewAssoc} is an association list identical to
		\arg{Assoc} except that the value associated with \arg{Key}
		is \arg{New} instead of \arg{Old}.

	\predicate{list_to_assoc}{2}{+List, ?Assoc}
		\arg{Assoc} is an association list corresponding to
		the Key-Value pairs in \arg{List}.

	\predicate{map_assoc}{2}{:Goal, +Assoc}
		\arg{Goal(V)} is true for every value V in \arg{Assoc}.

	\predicate{map_assoc}{3}{:Goal, +AssocIn, ?AssocOut}
		\arg{AssocOut} is \arg{AssocIn} with \arg{Goal} applied
		to all corresponding pairs of values.

	\predicate{max_assoc}{3}{+Assoc, ?Key, ?Value}
		\arg{Key} and \arg{Value} are key and value of the element
		with the largest key in \arg{Assoc}.

	\predicate{min_assoc}{3}{+Assoc, ?Key, ?Value}
		\arg{Key} and \arg{Value} are key and value of the element
		with the smallest key in \arg{Assoc}.

	\predicate{ord_list_to_assoc}{2}{+List, ?Assoc}
		\arg{Assoc} is an association list correpsond to the Key-Value
		pairs in \arg{List}, which must occur in ascending order of
		their keys.

	\predicate{put_assoc}{4}{+Key, +Assoc, +Value, ?NewAssoc}
		\arg{NewAssoc} is an association list identical to
		\arg{Assoc} except that \arg{Key} is associated with
		\arg{Value}. This can be used to insert and change
		associations.
