>\chapter{Tabled execution (SLG resolution)}
\label{sec:tabling}

\index{SLG,resolution}%
This chapter describes SWI-Prolog's support for \jargon{Tabled
execution} for one or more Prolog predicates, also called \jargon{SLG
resolution}. Tabling a predicate provides two properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
	Re-evaluation of a tabled predicate is avoided by
	\jargon{memoizing} the answers. This can realise huge
	performance enhancements as illustrated in
	\secref{tabling-memoize}. It also comes with two downsides: the
	memoized answers are not automatically updated or invalidated if
	the world (set of predicates on which the answers depend)
	changes and the answer tables must be stored (in memory).

  \item
	\jargon{Left recursion}, a goal calling a \jargon{variant} of
	itself recursively and thus \textit{looping} under the normal
	Prolog SLD resolution is avoided by suspending the variant call
	and resuming it with answers from the table.  This is illustrated
	in \secref{tabling-non-termination}.
\end{enumerate}

Tabling is particularly suited to simplify inference over a highly
entangled set of predicates that express axioms and rules in a static
(not changing) world. When using SLD resolution for such problems, it is
hard to ensure termination and avoid frequent recomputation of
intermediate results. A solution is to use Datalog style bottom-up
evaluation, i.e., applying rules on the axioms and derived facts until a
fixed point is reached. However, bottom-up evaluation typically derives
many facts that are never used. Tabling provides a \jargon{goal
oriented} resolution strategy for such problems and is enabled simply by
adding a table/1 directive to the program.


\section{Example 1: using tabling for memoizing}
\label{sec:tabling-memoize}

As a first classical example we use tabling for \emph{memoizing}
intermediate results. We use Fibonacci numbers to illustrate the
approach.  The Fibonacci number $I$ is defined as the sum of the
Fibonacci numbers for $I-1$ and $I-2$, while the Fibonacci number
of 0 and 1 are both defined to be 1.  This can be translated naturally
into Prolog:

\begin{code}
fib(0, 1) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
        N > 1,
	N1 is N-1,
	N2 is N-2,
	fib(N1, F1),
	fib(N2, F2),
	F is F1+F2.
\end{code}

The complexity of executing this using SLD resolution however is $2^N$
and thus becomes prohibitively slow rather quickly, e.g., the execution
time for $N=30$ is already 0.4 seconds. Using tabling, \term{fib}{N,F}
for each value of $N$ is computed only once and the algorithm becomes
linear. Tabling effectively inverts the execution order for this case:
it suspends the final addition (F is F1+F2) until the two preceeding
Fibonacci numbers have been added to the answer tables. Thus, we can
reduce the complexity from the show-stopping $2^N$ to linear by adding a
tabling directive and otherwise not changing the algorithm. The code
becomes:

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(tabling)).
:- table fib/2.

fib(0, 1) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
        N > 1,
	N1 is N-1,
	N2 is N-2,
	fib(N1, F1),
	fib(N2, F2),
	F is F1+F2.
\end{code}

The price that we pay is that a table \term{fib}{I,F} is created for
each $I$ in $0..N$. The execution time for $N=30$ is now 1 millisecond
and computing the Fibonacci number for $N=1000$ is doable (output edited
for readability).

\begin{code}
1 ?- time(fib(1000, X)).
% 52,991 inferences, 0.013 CPU in 0.013 seconds
X = 70330367711422815821835254877183549770181269836358
    73274260490508715453711819693357974224949456261173
    34877504492417659910881863632654502236471060120533
    74121273867339111198139373125598767690091902245245
    323403501.
\end{code}

In the case of Fibonacci numbers we can still rather easily achieve
linear complexity using program transformation, where we use bottom-up
instead of top-down evaluation, i.e., we compute \term{fib}{N,F} for
growing $N$, where we pass the last two Fibonacci numbers to the next
iteration. Not having to create the tables and not having to suspend and
resume goals makes this implementation about 25 times faster than the
tabled one. However, even in this simple case the transformation is not
obvious and it is far more difficult to recognise the algorithm as an
implementation of Fibonacci numbers.

\begin{code}
fib(0, 1) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
	fib(1,1,1,N,F).

fib(_F, F1, N, N, F1) :- !.
fib(F0, F1, I, N, F) :-
	F2 is F0+F1,
	I2 is I + 1,
	fib(F1, F2, I2, N, F).
\end{code}


\section{Example 2: avoiding non-termination}
\label{sec:tabling-non-termination}

SLD resolution easily results in an infinite loop due to \jargon{left
recursion}, a goal that (indirectly) calls a variant of itself or cycles
in the input data. Thus, if we have a series of
\nopredref{connection}{2} statements that define railway connections
between two cities, we cannot use the most natural logical definition to
express that we can travel between two cities:

\begin{code}
% :- use_module(library(tabling)).
% :- table connection/2.

connection(X, Y) :-
	connection(X, Z),
	connection(Z, Y).
connection(X, Y) :-
	connection(Y, X).

connection('Amsterdam', 'Schiphol').
connection('Amsterdam', 'Haarlem').
connection('Schiphol', 'Leiden').
connection('Haarlem', 'Leiden').
\end{code}

After enabling tabling however, the above works just fine as illustrated
in the session below.  Where is the magic and what is the price we
paid? The magic is, again, the fact that new goals to the tabled
predicate suspend. So, all recursive goals are suspended. Eventually, a
table for \term{connection}{'Amsterdam', X} is created with the two
direct connections from Amsterdam. Now, it resumes the first clause
using the tabled solutions, continuing the last
\nopredref{connection}{2} subgoal with \term{connection}{'Schiphol', X}
and \term{connection}{'Haarlem', X}. These two go through the same
process, creating new suspended recursive calls and creating tables for
the connections from Schiphol and Haarlem. Eventually, we end up with a
set of tables for each call variant that is involved in computing the
transitive closure of the network starting in Amsterdam. However, if the
Japanese rail network would have been in our data as well, we would not
have produced tables for that.

\begin{code}
1 ?- connection('Amsterdam', X).
X = 'Haarlem' ;
X = 'Schiphol' ;
X = 'Amsterdam' ;
X = 'Leiden'.
\end{code}

Again, the fact that a simple table/1 directive turns the pure logical
specification into a fairly efficient algorithm is a clear advantage.
Without tabling the program needs to be \jargon{stratified}, introducing
a base layer with the raw connections, a second layer that introduces
the \jargon{commutative} property of a railway (if you can travel from
$A$ to $B$ you can also travel from $B$ to $A$ and a final layer that
realises \jargon{transitivity} (if you can travel from $A$ to $B$ and
from $B$ to $C$ you can also travel from $A$ to $C$). The third and
final layer must keep track which cities you have already visited to
avoid traveling in circles. The transformed program however uses little
memory (the list of already visited cities and the still open choices)
and does not need to deal with maintaining consistency between the
tables and ground facts.

\section{Answer subsumption or mode directed tabling}
\label{sec:tabling-mode-directed}

\index{answer subsumption,tabling}%
Tabling as defined above has a serious limitation. Although the
definition of \nopredref{connection}{2} from section
\secref{tabling-non-termination} can compute the transitive closure of
connected cities, it cannot provide you with a route to travel. The
reason is that there are infinitely many routes if there are cycles in
the network and each new route found will be added to the answer table
and cause the tabled execution's completion algorithm to search for more
routes, eventually running out of memory.

The solution to this problem is called \jargon{mode directed tabling} or
\jargon{answer subsumption}.\footnote{The term \jargon{answer
subsumption} is used by XSB and \jargon{mode directed tabling} by YAP
and B-Prolog. The idea is that some arguments are considered `outputs',
where multiple values for the same `input' are combined. Possibly
\jargon{answer aggregation} would have been a better name.} In this
execution model one or more arguments are \emph{not} added to the table.
Instead, we remember a single \jargon{aggregated} value for these
arguments. The example below is derived from
\secref{tabling-non-termination} and returns the connection as a list of
cities. This argument is defined as a \jargon{moded} argument using the
\term{lattice}{PI} mode.\footnote{This mode is compatible to XSB
Prolog.} This causes the tabling engine each time that it finds an new
path to call \nopredref{shortest}{3} and keep the shortest route.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(tabling)).
:- table
    connection(_,_,lattice(shortest/3)).

shortest(P1, P2, P):-
    length(P1, L1),
    length(P2, L2),
    (   L1 < L2
    ->  P = P1
    ;   P = P2
    ).

connection(X, Y, [X,Y]) :-
    connection(X, Y).
connection(X, Y, P) :-
    connection(X, Z, P0),
    connection(Z, Y),
    append(P0, [Y], P).
\end{code}

The mode declation scheme is equivalent to XSB with partial
compatibility support for YAP and B-Prolog. The \term{lattice}{PI} mode
is the most general mode.  The YAP \const{all} (B-Prolog \const{@}) mode
is not yet supported. The list below describes the supported modes and
indicates the portability.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{Var}{}
\nodescription
    \termitem{+}{}
    \termitem{index}{}
A variable (XSB), the atom \const{index} (YAP) or a \const{+}
(B-Prolog, YAP) declare that the argument is tabled normally.

    \termitem{lattice}{PI}
\arg{PI} must be the predicate indicator of a predicate with arity~3.
On each answer, \arg{PI} is called with three arguments: the current
aggregated answer and the new answer are inputs.  The last argument
must be unified with a term that represents the new aggregated answer.
In SWI-Prolog the arity (3) may be omitted. See the example above.

    \termitem{po}{PI}
\jargon{Partial Ordening}. The new answer is added iff
\term{call}{PI, +Old, +Answer} succeeds. For example, \verb$po('<'/2)$
accumulates the largest result. In SWI-Prolog the arity (2) may be
omitted, resulting in \verb$po(<)$.

    \termitem{-}{}
\nodescription
    \termitem{first}{}
The atom \const{-} (B-Prolog, YAP) and \const{first} (YAP) declare to
keep the first answer for this argument.

    \termitem{last}{}
The atom \const{last} (YAP) declares to keep the last answer.

    \termitem{min}{}
The atom \const{min} (YAP) declares to keep the smallest answer
according to the standard order of terms (see \predref{@<}{2}). Note
that in SWI-Prolog the standard order of terms orders numbers by value.

    \termitem{max}{}
The atom \const{max} (YAP) declares to keep the largest answer
according to the standard order of terms (see \predref{@>}{2}). Note
that in SWI-Prolog the standard order of terms orders numbers by value.

    \termitem{sum}{}
The atom \const{sum} (YAP) declares to sum numeric answers.
\end{description}


\section{Tabling for impure programs}
\label{sec:tnotpure}

Tabling guarantees logically correct results and termination provided
the computation only involves terms of bounded size on \emph{pure}
Prolog programs, i.e., Prolog programs without side effects or pruning
of choice points (cut, \predref{->}{2}, etc.). Notably pruning choice
points of an incomplete tabled goal may cause an incomplete table and
thus cause subsequent queries for the same goal to return an incomplete
set of answers. The current SWI-Prolog implementation provides several
mechanisms to improve on this situation.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Dynamic Strongly Connected Components (SCC)]
Tabled goals are \jargon{completed} as soon as possible. Each fresh
tabled goal creates a scheduling component which the system attempts to
solve immediately. If a subgoal of the fresh goal refers to an
incomplete tabled goal the scheduling components for both goals are
merged such that the related goals are completed together. Dynamic
rather than static determination of strongly connected components
guarantees that the components are minimal because only actually reached
code needs to be considered rather than maximally reachable code.

Minimal SCCs imply that goals are completed as early as possible. This
implies that tabled goals may be embedded in e.g., findall/3 or be used
as a condition as long as there is no dependency (\jargon{loop}) with
goals outside the findall/3 or condition. For example, the code below
misbehaves when called as \term{p}{X} because the argument of findall/3
calls a \jargon{variant} of the goal that initiated the findall goal. A
call \term{p}{1} however is ok as \term{p}{1} is not a variant of
\term{p}{X}.

\begin{code}
p(X) :-
    findall(Y, p(Y), Ys),
    ...
\end{code}

    \item [Early completion]
Ground goals, i.e., goals without variables, are subject to early
completion. This implies they are considered completed after the first
solution.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Variant and subsumptive tabling}
\label{sec:tabling-subsumptive}

By default, SWI-Prolog (and other Prolog systems with tabling) create a
table per call \jargon{variant}. A call (term) is a variant of another
call (term) if there is a renaming of variables that makes the two terms
equal. See \predref{=@=}{2} for details. Consider the following program:

\begin{code}
:- table p/1.

p(X) :- p(Y), Y < 10 000, X is Y+1.
p(1).
\end{code}

Calling \term{p}{X} creates a table for this variant with 10,000
answers. Calling \term{p}{42} creates a new table where the recursive
call (\term{p}{Y}) uses the previously created table to enumerate all
values $1\ldots{}41$ before deriving \term{p}{42} is true. \jargon{Early
completion} (see \secref{tnotpure}) in this case prevents enumerating
all answers for \term{p}{Y} ($1\ldots{}10,000$). As a result, the query
below runs in quadratic time and creates a 10,000 additional tables.

\begin{code}
?- time(forall(between(1, 10 000, X), p(X))).
% 150,370,553 inferences, 13.256 CPU in 13.256 seconds
\end{code}

\jargon{Subsumptive} tabling answers a query using answers from a more
general table. In this case, this means it uses basically trie_gen/2 to
get the answer \term{p}{42} from the table \term{p}{_}.  This leads to
the program and results shown below.

\begin{code}
:- table p/1 as subsumptive.

p(X) :- p(Y), Y < 10 000, X is Y+1.
p(1).
\end{code}

\begin{code}
?- time(p(_)).
% 140,066 inferences, 0.015 CPU in 0.015 seconds
?- time(t).
% 170,005 inferences, 0.016 CPU in 0.016 seconds
\end{code}

This may make you wonder why subsumptive tabling is not the default.
There are also some drawbacks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Subsumptive tabling only provides correct support if
instances (more specific) queries indeed provides answers that
are consistent with the more general query.  This is true for
\jargon{pure programs}, but not guaranteed for arbitrary Prolog
programs.
    \item Finding more generic tables is more complicated and
expensive than finding the call variant table and extracting the subset
of answers that match the more specific query can be expensive.
    \item Using subsumptive tables can create more dependencies
in the call graph which can slow down the table completion
process.  Larger dependent components also negatively impact the
issues discussed in \secref{tnotpure}.
\end{itemize}

In the current implementation, SWI-Prolog only uses the more general
table if this table is \jargon{completed}.  This is likely to change
in future versions.


\section{Well Founded Semantics}
\label{sec:WFS}

According to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_semantics}{Wikipedia},
"\jargon{Well Founded Semantics} is one definition of how we can make
conclusions from a set of logical rules". Well Founded Semantics (WFS)
defines a \jargon{three valued logic} representing \jargon{true},
\jargon{false} and something that is neither true or false. This latter
value is often referred to as \jargon{bottom}, \jargon{undefined} or
\jargon{unknown}.  SWI-Prolog uses undefined/0.

Well Founded Semantics allows for reasoning about programs with
contradictions or multiple answer sets. It allows for obtaining
true/false results for literals that do not depend on the sub program
that has no unambiguous solution, propagating the notion of
\jargon{undefined} to literals that cannot be resolved otherwise and
obtaining the \jargon{residual} program that expresses why an answer is
not unambiguous.

The notion of \jargon{Well Founded Semantics} is only relevant if the
program uses \jargon{negation} as implemented by tnot/1. The argument of
tnot/1, as the name implies, must be a goal associated with a tabled
predicate (see table/1).  In a nutshell, resolving a goal that implies
tnot/1 is implemented as follows:

Consider the following partial \jargon{body term}:

\begin{code}
	...,
	tnot(p),
        q.
\end{code}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item
If $p$ has an unconditional answer in its table, fail.
    \item
Else, \jargon{delay} the negation.  If an unconditional
answer arrives at some time, resume with failure.
    \item
If at the end of the traditional tabled evaluation we
can still not decide on $p$, execute the \jargon{continuation}
($q$ above) while maintaining the \jargon{delay list} set to
\term{tnot}{p}.  If executing the continuation results in an
answer for some tabled predicate, record this answer as a
\jargon{conditional} answer, in this case with the condition
\term{tnot}{p}.
    \item
If a conditional answer is added to a table, it is propagated to its
\jargon{followers}, say $f$, adding the pair \{$f$,answer\} to the
delay list. If this leads to an answer, the answer is conditonal
on this pair.
    \item
After the continuations of all unresolved tnot/1 calls have
been executed the various tables may have conditional answers
in addition to normal answers.
    \item
If there are negative literals that have neither conditional answers
nor unconditional answers, the condition \term{tnot}{g} is true.
This conclusion is propagated by simplifying the conditions for
all answers that depend on \term{tnot}{g}.  This may result in
a definite \jargon{false} condition, in which case the answer
is removed or a definite \jargon{true} condition in which case
the answer is made unconditional.  Both events can make other
conditional answers definitely true or false, etc.
    \item
At the end of the simplifying process some answers may still be
conditional.  A final \jargon{answer completion} step analyses
the graph of depending nodes, eliminating \jargon{positive loops},
e.g., ``$p$ :- $q$.  $q$ :- $p$''.  The answers in such a loop are
removed, possibly leading to more simplification.  This process is
executed until \jargon{fixed point} is reached, i.e., no further
positive loops exist and no further simplification is possible.
\end{enumerate}

The above process may complete without any remaining conditional
answers, in which case we are back in the normal Prolog world. It is
also possible that some answers remain conditional. The most obvious
case is represented by undefined/0. The toplevel responds with
\textbf{undefined} instead of \textbf{true} if an answer is conditional.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{undefined}{0}{}
Unknown represents neither \const{true} nor \const{false} in the
well formed model.  It is implemented as

\begin{code}
:- table undefined/0.

undefined :- tnot(undefined).
\end{code}
\end{description}

\index{residual,WFS}%
Solving a set of predicates under well formed semantics results in a
\jargon{residual program}. This program contains clauses for all tabled
predicates with condition answers where each clause head represents and
answer and each clause body its condition. The condition is a
disjunction of conjunctions where each literal is either a tabled
goal or tnot/1 of a tabled goal.   The remaining model has at least a
cycle through a negative literal (tnot/1) and has no single
solution in the \jargon{stable model semantics}, i.e., it either
expresses a contradition (as undefined/0, i.e., there is no stable model)
or a multiple stable models as in the program below, where both \{p\}
and \{q\} are stable models.

\begin{code}
:- table p/0, q/0.

p :- tnot(q).
q :- tnot(p).
\end{code}

Note that it is possible that some literals have the same truth value in
all stable models but are still \jargon{undefined} under the stable model
semantics.

The residual program is an explanation of why an answer is undefined.
SWI-Prolog offers the following predicates to access the residual
program.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{call_residual_program}{:Goal, -Program}
True when \arg{Goal} is an answer according to the Well Founded
Semantics.  If \arg{Program} is the empty list, \arg{Goal} is
unconditionally true.  Otherwise this is a program as described
by delays_residual_program/2.

    \predicate{call_delays}{2}{:Goal, -Condition}
True when \arg{Goal} is an answer that is true when Condition can be
satisfied. If \arg{Condition} is \const{true}, \arg{Answer} is
unconditional. Otherwise it is a conjunction of goals, each of which is
associated with a tabled predicate.

    \predicate{delays_residual_program}{2}{:Condition, -Program}
Program is a list of clauses that represents the connected program
associated with \arg{Condition}.  Each clause head represents a
conditional answer from a table and each corresponding clause body
is the condition that must hold for this answer to be true.  The
body is a disjunction of conjunctions.  Each leaf in this condition
is either a term \term{tnot}{Goal} or a plain \arg{Goal}.  Each
\arg{Goal} is associated with a tabled predicate.  The program
always contains at least one cycle that involves tnot/1.
\end{description}


\subsection{Well founded semantics and the toplevel}
\label{sec:wfs-toplevel}

The toplevel supports two modes for reporting that it is undefined whether
the current answer is true. The mode is selected by the Prolog flag
\prologflag{toplevel_list_wfs_residual_program}. If \const{true}, the
toplevel uses call_delays/2 and delays_residual_program/2 to find the
conditional answers used and the \jargon{residual} program associated
with these answers. It then prints the residual program, followed by the
answer and the conditional answers. For undefined/0, this results in the
following output:

\begin{code}
?- undefined.
% WFS residual program
    undefined :-
        tnot(undefined).
undefined.
\end{code}

If the \prologflag{toplevel_list_wfs_residual_program} is false, any
undefined answer is a conjunction with undefined/0.  See the program and
output below.

\begin{code}
:- table p/0, q/0.

p :- tnot(q).
q :- tnot(p).
\end{code}

\begin{code}
?- p.
% WFS residual program
    p :-
        tnot(q).
    q :-
        tnot(p).
p.

?- set_prolog_flag(toplevel_list_wfs_residual_program, false).
true.

?- p.
undefined.
\end{code}


\section{Tabling predicate reference}
\label{sec:tabling-preds}

\begin{description}
    \directive{table}{1}{:Specification}
Prepare the predicates specified by \arg{Specification} for tabled
execution.  \arg{Specification} is a \jargon{comma-list}, each member
specifying tabled execution for a specific predicate.  The individual
specification is either a \jargon{predicate indicator} (name/arity or
name//arity) or head specifing tabling with \jargon{answer subsumption}.

Although table/1 is normally used as a directive, SWI-Prolog allows
calling it as a runtime predicate to prepare an existing predicate for
tabled execution. The predicate untable/1 can be used to remove the
tabling instrumentation from a predicate.

The example below prepares the predicate edge/2 and the
non-terminal statement//1 for tabled execution.

\begin{code}
:- table edge/2, statement//1.
\end{code}

Below is an example declaring a predicate to use tabling with
\jargon{answer subsumption}. Answer subsumption or \jargon{mode directed
tabling} is discussed in \secref{tabling-mode-directed}.

\begin{code}
:- table connection(_,_,min).
\end{code}

Additional tabling options can be provided using a term \funcref{as}{2},
which can be applied to a single specification or a comma list of
specifications.  The options themselves are a comma-list of one or more
of the following atoms:

    \begin{description}
    \termitem{variant}{}
    Default.  Create a table for each call variant.
    \termitem{subsumptive}{}
    Instead of creating a new table for each call variant, check
    whether there is a completed table for a more general goal and
    if this is the case extract the answers from this table.  See
    \secref{tabling-subsumptive}.
    \end{description}

This syntax is closely related to the table declarations used in XSB
Prolog. Where in XSB \const{as} is an operator with priority above the
priority of the comma, it is an operator with priority below the comma
in SWI-Prolog. Therefore, multiple predicates or options must be
enclosed in parenthesis. For example:

\begin{code}
:- table p/1 as subsumptive.
:- table (q/1, r/2) as subsumptive.
\end{code}

    \predicate{tnot}{1}{:Goal}
The tnot/1 predicate implements \jargon{tabled negation}. This predicate
realises \jargon{Well Founded Semantics}. See \secref{WFS} for details.

    \predicate{current_table}{2}{:Variant, -Trie}
True when \arg{Trie} is the answer table for \arg{Variant}.

    \predicate{untable}{:Specification}
Remove the tabling instrumentation for the specified predicates.
\arg{Specification} is compatible with table/1, although tabling with
\jargon{answer subsumption} may be removed using a name/arity
specification.

    \predicate{abolish_all_tables}{0}{}
Remove all tables. This is normally used to free up the space or
recompute the result after predicates on which the result for some
tabled predicates depend. Raises a permission_error when tabling is in
progress.

    \predicate{abolish_table_subgoals}{1}{:Subgoal}
Abolish all tables that unify with \arg{SubGoal}.
\end{description}


\section{About the tabling implementation}
\label{sec:tabling-about}

The SWI-Prolog implementation uses \jargon{Delimited continuations} (see
\secref{delcont} to realise suspension of variant calls. The initial
version was written by Benoit Desouter and described in
\cite{DBLP:journals/tplp/DesouterDS15}. We moved the main data
structures required for tabling, the \jargon{answer tables} (see
\secref{trie}) and the \jargon{worklist} to SWI-Prolog's C~core.
\jargon{Mode directed tabling} (\secref{tabling-mode-directed}) is based
on a prototype implementation by Fabrizio Riguzzi.

The implementation of dynamic SCCs, dynamically stratified negation and
Well Founded Semantics was initiated by Benjamin Grosof from Kyndi and
was realised with a lot of help by Theresa Swift, David Warren and
Fabrizio Riguzzi, as well as publications about XSB
\cite{DBLP:journals/toplas/SagonasS98,SAGONAS20001}.

The table/1 directive causes the creation of a wrapper calling the
renamed original predicate. For example, the program in
\secref{tabling-non-termination} is translated into the following
program. We give this information to improve your understanding of the
current tabling implementation. Future versions are likely to use a more
low-level translation that is not based on wrappers.


\begin{code}
connection(A, B) :-
	start_tabling(user:connection(A, B),
		      'connection tabled'(A, B)).

'connection tabled'(X, Y) :-
	connection(X, Z),
	connection(Z, Y).
'connection tabled'(X, Y) :-
	connection(Y, X).

'connection tabled'('Amsterdam', 'Schiphol').
'connection tabled'('Amsterdam', 'Haarlem').
'connection tabled'('Schiphol', 'Leiden').
'connection tabled'('Haarlem', 'Leiden').
\end{code}


\subsubsection{Status of tabling}
\label{sec:tabling-status}

The current implementation is merely a first prototype. It needs several
enhancements before we can consider it a serious competitor to Prolog
systems with mature tabling such as XSB, YAP and B-Prolog. In
particular,

\begin{shortlist}
    \item The performance needs to be improved.
    \item Memory usage needs to be reduced.
    \item Tables must be shared between threads, both to
          reduce space and avoid recomputation.
    \item Tables must be invalidated and reclaimed automatically.
    \item Notably XSB supports incremental tabeling and well-founded
          semantics under negation.
\end{shortlist}
