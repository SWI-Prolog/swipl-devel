This chapter explains issues for writing portable Prolog programs. It
was started after discussion with Vitor Santos Costa, the leading
developer of YAP Prolog\footnote{\url{http://yap.sourceforge.net/}} YAP
and SWI-Prolog have expressed the ambition to enhance the portability
beyond the trivial Prolog examples, including complex libraries
involving foreign code.

Although it is our aim to enhance compatibility, we are still faced
with many incompatibilities between the dialects. As a first step both
YAP and SWI will provide some instruments that help developing portable
code. A first release of these tools appeared in SWI-Prolog 5.6.43.
Some of the facilities are implemented in the base system, others in the
library \pllib{dialect.pl}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Prolog flag \prologflag{dialect} is an unambiguous and fast way to
    find out which Prolog dialect executes your program. It has the
    value \const{swi} for SWI-Prolog and \const{yap} on YAP.

    \item The Prolog flag \prologflag{version_data} is bound to a term
    \term{swi}{Major, Minor, Patch, Extra}

    \item Conditional compilation using \exam{:- if(Condition)} \ldots
    \exam{:- endif} is supported.  See \secref{conditionalcompilation}.

    \item The predicate expects_dialect/1 allows for specifying for
    which Prolog system the code was written.

    \item The predicates exists_source/1 and source_exports/2 can be
    used to query the library content.  The require/1 directive can
    be used to get access to predicates without knowing their location.

    \item The module predicates use_module/1, use_module/2 have been
    extended with a notion for `import-except' and `import-as'.  This
    is particularly useful together with reexport/1 and reexport/2 to
    compose modules from other modules and mapping names.

    \item Foreign code can expect \const{__SWI_PROLOG__} when compiled
    for SWI-Prolog and \const{__YAP_PROLOG__} when compiled on YAP.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
    \directive{expects_dialect}{1}{+Dialect}
This directive states that the code following the directive is written
for the given Prolog \arg{Dialect}. See also \prologflag{dialect}. The
declaration holds until the end of the file in which it appears. The
current dialect is available using prolog_load_context/2.

The exact behaviour of this predicate is still subject to discussion. Of
course, if \arg{Dialect} matches the running dialect the directive has
no effect. Otherwise we check for the existence of
\term{library}{dialect/Dialect} and load it if the file is found.
Currently, this file has this functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Define system predicates of the requested dialect we do not
    have.

    \item Apply goal_expansion/2 rules that map conflicting predicates
    to versions emulating the requested dialect. These expansion rules
    reside in the dialect compatibility module, but are
    applied if prolog_load_context(dialect, Dialect) is active.

    \item Modify the search path for library directories, putting
    libraries compatible with the target dialect before the native
    libraries.

    \item Setup support for the default filename extension of the
    dialect.
\end{itemize}

    \predicate{source_exports}{2}{+Spec, +Export}
Is true if source \arg{Spec} exports \arg{Export}, a predicate
indicator.  Fails without error otherwise.
\end{description}


\section{Some considerations for writing portable code}
\label{sec:portabilitystrategies}

The traditional way to write portable code is to define custom
predicates for all potentially non-portable code and define these
separately for all Prolog dialects one wishes to support.  Here
are some considerations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Probably the best reason for this is that it allows to
    define minimal semantics required by the application
    for the portability predicates.  Such functionality can often
    be mapped efficiently to the target dialect.  Contrary, if
    code was written for dialect $X$, the defined semantics are
    those of dialect $X$. Emulating all extreme cases and full
    error handling compatibility may be tedious and result in a
    much slower implementation than needed.  Take for example
    call_cleanup/2.  The SICStus definition is fundamentally
    different from the SWI definition, but 99\% of the applications
    just want to make calls like below to guarantee \arg{StreamIn}
    is closed, even if \nopredref{process}{1} misbehaves.

\begin{code}
	call_cleanup(process(StreamIn), close(In))
\end{code}

    \item As a drawback, the code becomes full of \textit{my_call_cleanup},
    etc.\ and every potential portability conflict needs to be
    abstracted.  It is hard for people who have to maintain such code
    later to grasp the exact semantics of the \textit{my_*} predicates
    and applications that combine multiple libraries using this
    compatibility approach are likely to encounter conflicts between
    the portability layers.  A good start is not to use \textit{my_*},
    but a prefix derived from the library or application name or names
    that explain the intended semantics more precisely.

    \item Another problem is that most code is initially not written
    with portability in mind.  Instead, ports are requested by users
    or arise from the desire to switch Prolog dialect.  Typically, we
    want to achieve compatibility with the new Prolog dialect with
    minimal changes, often keeping compatibility with the original
    dialect(s).  This problem is well known from the C/Unix world
    and we advise anyone to study the philosophy of
    \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}{GNU autoconf}, from
    which we will illustrate some highlights below.
\end{itemize}

The GNU autoconf suite, known to most people as \program{configure}, was
an answer to the frustrating life of Unix/C programmers when Unix
dialects were about as abundant and poorly standardised as Prolog
dialects today. Writing a portable C program can only be achieved using
cpp, the C preprocessor. The C preprocessor performs two tasks: macro
expansion and conditional compilation. Prolog realises macro expansion
through term_expansion/2 and goal_expansion/2. Conditional compilation
is achieved using \exam{:- if(Condition)} as explained in
\secref{conditionalcompilation}. The situation appears similar.

The important lesson learned from GNU autoconf is that the \emph{last}
resort for conditional compilation to achieve portability is to switch
on the platform or dialect. Instead, GNU autoconf allows you to write
tests for specific properties of the platform. Most of these are whether
or not some function or file is available. Then there are some standard
tests for difficult-to-write-portable situations and finally there is a
framework that allows you to write arbitrary C programs and check
whether they can be compiled and/or whether they show the intended
behaviour. Using a separate \program{configure} program is needed in C,
as you cannot perform C compilation step or run C programs from the C
preprocessor. In most Prolog environments we do not need this
distinction as the compiler is integrated into the runtime environment
and Prolog has excellent reflexion capabilities.

We must learn from the distinction to test for features instead of
platform (dialect), as this makes the platform-specific code robust for
future changes of the dialect. Suppose we need compare/3 as defined in
this manual. The compare/3 predicate is not part of the ISO standard,
but many systems support it and it is not unlikely it will become ISO
standard or the intended dialect will start supporting it. GNU autoconf
strongly advises to test for the availability:

\begin{code}
:- if(\+current_predicate(_, compare(_,_,_))).
compare(<, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @< Term2, !.
compare(>, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @> Term2, !.
compare(=, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 == Term2.
:- endif.
\end{code}

This code is \textbf{much} more robust against changes to the intended
dialect and, possibly at least as important, will provide compatibility
with dialects you didn't even consider porting to right now.

In a more challenging case, the target Prolog has compare/3, but the
semantics are different. What to do? One option is to write a
my_compare/3 and change all occurrences in the code. Alternatively you
can rename calls using goal_expansion/2 like below. This construct will
not only deal with Prolog dialects lacking compare/3 as well as those that
only implement it for numeric comparison or have changed the argument
order. Of course, writing rock-solid code would require a complete
test-suite, but this example will probably cover all Prolog dialects
that allow for conditional compilation, have core ISO facilities and
provide goal_expansion/2, the things we claim a Prolog dialect should
have to start writing portable code for it.

\begin{code}
:- if(\+catch(compare(<,a,b), _, fail)).
compare_standard_order(<, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @< Term2, !.
compare_standard_order(>, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @> Term2, !.
compare_standard_order(=, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 == Term2.

goal_expansion(compare(Order, Term1, Term2),
	       compare_standard_order(Order, Term1, Term2)).
:- endif.
\end{code}

\section{Notes on specific dialects}
\label{sec:dialect-notes}

The level of maturity of the various dialect emulation implementations
varies enormously. All of them have been developed to realise
portability for one or more, often large, programs.  This section
provides some notes on emulating a particular dialect.


\subsection{Notes on specific dialects}
\label{sec:dialect-xsb}

\href{http://xsb.sourceforge.net/}{XSB} Prolog compatibility emerged
from a project to integrate XSB's advanced tabling support in SWI-Prolog
(see \secref{tabling}). This project has been made possible by
\href{https://kyndi.com/}{Kyndi}.\footnote{This project was initiated by
Benjamin Grosof and carried out in cooperation with Theresa Swift, David
S. Warren and Fabrizio Riguzzi.} The XSB dialect implementation has been
created to share as much as possible of the XSB test suite as well as
some larger programs to evaluate both tabling implementations. The
dialect emulation was extended to support
\href{https://github.com/cmu-sei/pharos}{Pharos}.\footnote{Pharos was
used to evaluate \jargon{incremental tabling}
(\secref{tabling-incremental}), a protect with Edward Schwatz and Cory
Cohen from CMU}.

Emulating XSB is relatively complicated due to the large distance from
the Quintus decendant Prolog systems. Notably XSB's name based module
system is hard to map on SWI-Prolog's predicate based module system. As
a result, only non-modular projects or projects with basic usage of
modules are supported. For the development of new projects that require
modules more advanced module support we suggest using
\href{https://logtalk.org/}{Logtalk}.

\subsubsection{Loading XSB source files}
\label{sec:xsb-source}

SWI-Prolog's emulation of XSB depends on the XSB preferred file name
extension \fileext{P}. This extension is used by
\pllib{dialect/xsb/source} to initiate a two phase loading process based
on term_expansion/2 of the virtual term \const{begin_of_file}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the first phase the file is read with XSB compatible
    operator declarations and all directives (:- Term) are extracted.
    The directives are used to determine that the file defines a
    module (iff the file contains an export/1 directive) and construct
    a SWI-Prolog compatible module declaration.  As XSB has a two phase
    compiler where SWI has a single phase compiler, this is also used to
    move some directives to the start of the file.

    \item The second phase loads the file as normal.
\end{enumerate}

To load a project in both XSB and SWI-Prolog it is adviced to make sure
all source files use the \fileext{P} file name extension.  Next, write a
SWI-Prolog loader in a \fileext{pl} file that contains e.g.,

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(dialect/xsb/source)).

:- [main_file].
\end{code}

It is also possible to put the able use_module/1 directive in your
personal initialization file (see \secref{initfile}), after which
XSB files can be loaded as normal SWI-Prolog files using

\begin{code}
% swipl file.P
\end{code}

\index{gpp,XSB proprocessor}%
XSB code may depend on the \program{gpp} preprocessor.  We do not
provide \program{gpp}.  It is however possible to send XSB source
files through \program{gpp} by loading \pllib{library/dialect/xsb/gpp}.
This require \program{gpp} to be accessible through the environment
variable \env{PATH} or the file_search_path/2 alias \const{path}.
We refer to the \const{gpp} library for details.


\subsection{The XSB import directive}
\label{sec:xsb-import}

The XSB import directive takes the form as below.

\begin{code}
:- import p/1, q/2, ... from <lib>.
\end{code}

This import directive is resolved as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the referenced library is found as a local file,
it is loaded and the requested predicates are imported.
    \item Otherwise, the referenced libary is searched for in
the \file{dialect/xsb} directory of the SWI-Prolog library.
If found, the predicates are imported from this library.
    \item The referenced predicates are searched for in SWI-Prolog
built-in predicates and the SWI-Prolog library.  If found, they are
made available if necessary.
\end{itemize}
