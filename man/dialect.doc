This chapter explains issues for writing portable Prolog programs. It
was started after discussion with Vitor Santos Costa, the leading
developer of YAP Prolog\footnote{\url{http://yap.sourceforge.net/}} YAP
and SWI-Prolog have expressed the ambition to enhance the portability
beyond the trivial Prolog examples, including complex libraries
involving foreign code.

Although it is our aim to enhance compatibility, we are still faced
with many incompatibilities between the dialects. As a first step both
YAP and SWI will provide some instruments that help developing portable
code. A first release of these tools appears in SWI-Prolog 5.6.43.  Some
of the facilities are implemented in the base system.  Others in the
library \pllib{dialect.pl}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Prolog flag \prologflag{dialect} is an unambiguous and fast way to
    find out which Prolog dialect executes your program. It has the
    value \const{swi} for SWI-Prolog and \const{yap} on YAP.

    \item The Prolog flag \prologflag{version_number} is bound to an integer with
    value $10,000 \times major + 100 \times minor + patch$. I.e.\ 50642
    is version 5.6.42.

    \item Conditional compilation using \exam{:- if(Condition)} \ldots
    \exam{:- endif} is supported.  See \secref{conditionalcompilation}.

    \item The predicate expects_dialect/1 allows for specifying for
    which Prolog system the code was written.

    \item The predicates exists_source/1 and source_exports/2 can be
    used to query the library content.  The require/1 directive can
    be used to get access to predicates without knowing their location.

    \item Foreign code can expect \const{__SWI_PROLOG__} when compiled
    for SWI-Prolog and \const{__YAP_PROLOG__} when compiled on YAP.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
    \directive{expects_dialect}{1}{+Dialect}
This directive states that the code following the directive is written
for the given Prolog \arg{Dialect}. See also \prologflag{dialect}. The
declaration holds until the end of the file in which it appears. The
current dialect is available using prolog_load_context/2.

The exact behaviour of this predicate is still subject to discussion. Of
course, if \arg{Dialect} matches the running dialect the directive has
no effect. Otherwise we check for the existence of
\term{library}{dialect/Dialect} and load it if the file is found.
Currently, this file has this functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Define system predicates of the requested dialect we do not
    have.

    \item Apply goal_expansion/2 rules that map conflicting predicates
    to versions emulating the requested dialect. These expansion rules
    reside in the dialect compatibility module, but are
    applied if prolog_load_context(dialect, Dialect) is active.

    \item Modify the search path for library directories, putting 
    libraries compatible to the target dialect before the native
    libraries.

    \item Setup support for the default filename extension of the
    dialect.
\end{itemize}

    \predicate{exists_source}{1}{+Spec}
Is true if \arg{Spec} exists as a Prolog source.  \arg{Spec} uses the
same conventions as load_files/2.  Fails without error if \arg{Spec}
cannot be found.

    \predicate{source_exports}{2}{+Spec, +Export}
Is true if source \arg{Spec} exports \arg{Export}, a predicate
indicator.  Fails without error otherwise.
\end{description}


\section{Some considerations for writing portable code}
\label{sec:portabilitystrategies}

The traditional way to write portable code is to define custom
predicates for all potentially non-portable code and define these
separately for all Prolog dialects one wishes to support.  Here
are some considerations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Probably the best reason for this is that it allows to
    define minimal semantics required by the application 
    for the portability predicates.  Such functionality can often
    be mapped efficiently to the target dialect.  Contrary, if
    code was written for dialect $X$, the defined semantics are
    those of dialect $X$. Emulating all extreme cases and full
    error handling compatibility may be tedious and result in a
    much slower implementation that needed.  Take for example
    call_cleanup/2.  The SICStus definition is fundamentally 
    different from the SWI definition, but 99\% of the applications
    just want to make calls like below to guarantee \arg{StreamIn}
    is closed, even if \predref{process}{1} misbehaves.

\begin{code}
	call_cleanup(process(StreamIn), close(In))
\end{code}

    \item As a drawback, the code becomes full of \textit{my_call_cleanup},
    etc.\ and every potential portability conflict needs to be
    abstracted.  It is hard for people who have to maintain such code
    later to grasp the exact semantics of the \textit{my_*} predicates
    and applications that combine multiple libraries using this
    compatibility approach are likely to encounter conflicts between
    the portability layers.  A good start is not to use \textit{my_*},
    but a prefix derived from the library or application name or names
    that explain the intended semantics more precisely.

    \item Another problem is that most code is initially not written 
    with portability in mind.  Instead, ports are requested by users
    or arise from the desire to switch Prolog dialect.  Typically, we
    want to achieve compatibility with the new Prolog dialect with
    minimal changes, often keeping compatibility with the original
    dialect(s).  This problem is well known from the C/Unix world
    and we advice anyone to study the philosophy of
    \url[GNU autoconf]{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}, from
    which we will illustrate some highlights below.
\end{itemize}

The GNU autoconf suite, known to most people as \program{configure}, was
an answer to the frustrating life of Unix/C programmers when Unix
dialects were about as abundant and poorly standardised as Prolog
dialects today. Writing a portable C program can only be achieved using
cpp, the C preprocessor. The C preprocessor performs two tasks: macro
expansion and conditional compilation. Prolog realises macro expansion
through term_expanstion/2 and goal_expansion/2. Conditional compilation
is achieved using \exam{:- if(Condition)} as explained in
\secref{conditionalcompilation}. The situation appears similar.

The important lesson learned from GNU autoconf is that the \emph{last}
resort for conditional compilation to achieve portability is to switch
on the platform or dialect. Instead, GNU autoconf allows you to write
tests for specific properties of the platform. Most of these are whether
or not some function or file is available. Then there are some standard
tests for difficult-to-write-portable situations and finally there is a
framework that allows you to write arbitrary C programs and check
whether they can be compiled and/or whether they show the intended
behaviour. Using a separate \program{configure} program is needed in C,
as you cannot perform C compilation step or run C programs from the C
preprocessor. In most Prolog environments we do not need this
distinction as the compiler is integrated into the runtime environment
and Prolog has excelent reflexion capabilities.

We must learn from the distinction to test for features instead of
platform (dialect), as this makes the platform specific code robust for
future changes of the dialect. Suppose we need compare/3 as defined in
this manual. The compare/3 predicate is not part of the ISO standard,
but many systems support it and it is not unlikely it will become ISO
standard or the intended dialect will start supporting it. GNU autoconf
strongly advises to test for the availability:

\begin{code}
:- if(\+current_predicate(_, compare(_,_,_))).
compare(<, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @< Term2, !.
compare(>, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @> Term2, !.
compare(=, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 == Term2.
:- endif.
\end{code}

This code is \textbf{much} more robust against changes to the intended
dialect and, possible at least as important, will provide compatibility
to dialects you didn't even consider porting to right now.

In a more challenging case, the target Prolog has compare/3, but the
semantics are different. What to do? One option is to write a
my_compare/3 and change all occurrences in the code. Alternatively you
can rename calls using goal_expansion/2 like below. This construct will
not only deal with Prolog dialects lacking compare as well as those that
only implement it for numeric comparison or have changed the argument
order. Of course, writing rock-solid code would require a complete
test-suite, but this example will probably cover all Prolog dialects
that allow for conditional compilation, have core ISO facilities and
provide goal_expansion/2, the things we claim a Prolog dialect should
have to start writing portable code for it.

\begin{code}
:- if(\+catch(compare(<,a,b), _, fail)).
compare_standard_order(<, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @< Term2, !.
compare_standard_order(>, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 @> Term2, !.
compare_standard_order(=, Term1, Term2) :-
	Term1 == Term2.

goal_expansion(compare(Order, Term1, Term2),
	       compare_standard_order(Order, Term1, Term2)).
:- endif.
\end{code}
