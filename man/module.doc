\chapter{Modules}                 \label{sec:modules}

A Prolog module is a collection of predicates which defines a public
interface by means of a set of provided predicates and operators. Prolog
modules are defined by an ISO standard. Unfortunately, the standard is
considered a failure and, as far as we are aware, not implemented by any
concrete Prolog implementation. The SWI-Prolog module system is derived
from the Quintus Prolog module system. The Quintus module system has
been the starting points for the module systems of a number of
mainstream Prolog systems, such as SICStus, Ciao and YAP.

This chapter motivates and describes the SWI-Prolog module system.
Novices can start using the module system after reading
\secref{defmodule} and \secref{import}. The primitives defined in these
sections suffice for basic usage until one needs to export predicates
that call or manage other predicates dynamically (e.g., use call/1,
assert/1, etc.). Such predicates are called \jargon{meta predicates} and
are discussed in \secref{metapred}. \Secref{overrule} to \secref{moduleop}
describe more advanced issues. Starting with \secref{importmodule}, we
discuss more low-level aspects of the SWI-Prolog module systems that
are used to implement the visible module system, and can be used to
build other code reuse mechanisms.


\section{Why Using Modules?}		\label{sec:whymodules}

In classic Prolog systems, all predicates are organised in a single
namespace and any predicate can call any predicate. Because each
predicate in a file can be called from anywhere in the program, it
becomes very hard to find the dependencies and enhance the
implementation of a predicate without risking to break the overall
application.  This is true for any language, but even worse for
Prolog due to its frequent need for `helper predicates'.

A Prolog module encapsulates a set of predicates and defines an
\jargon{interface}. Modules can import other modules, which makes the
dependencies explicit. Given explicit dependencies and a well-defined
interface, it becomes much easier to change the internal organisation of
a module without breaking the overall application.

Explicit dependencies can also be used by the development environment.
The SWI-Prolog library \pllib{prolog_xref} can be used to analyse
completeness and consistency of modules. This library is used by the
built-in editor PceEmacs for syntax highlighting, jump-to-definition,
etc.


\section{Defining a Module}		\label{sec:defmodule}

Modules are normally created by loading a \jargon{module file}. A module
file is a file holding a module/2 directive as its first term. The
module/2 directive declares the name and the public (i.e., externally
visible) predicates of the module. The rest of the file is loaded into
the module. Below is an example of a module file, defining reverse/2 and
hiding the helper-predicate rev/3. A module can use all built-in
predicates and, by default, cannot redefine system predicates.

\begin{code}
:- module(reverse, [reverse/2]).

reverse(List1, List2) :-
        rev(List1, [], List2).

rev([], List, List).
rev([Head|List1], List2, List3) :-
        rev(List1, [Head|List2], List3).
\end{code}

The module is named \const{reverse}. Typically, the name of a module is
the same as the name of the file by which it is defined without the
filename extension, but this naming is not enforced. Modules are
organised in a single and flat namespace and therefore module names must
be chosen with some care to avoid conflicts. As we will see, typical
applications of the module system rarely use the name of a module
explicitly in the source text.

\begin{description}
    \directive{module}{2}{+Module, +PublicList}
This directive can only be used as the first term of a source file. It
declares the file to be a \jargon{module file}, defining a
module named \arg{Module} and exporting the predicates of
\arg{PublicList}. \arg{PublicList} is a list of predicate indicators
(name/arity or name//arity pairs) or operator declarations using the
format \term{op}{Precedence, Type, Name}. Operators defined in the
export list are available inside the module as well as to modules
importing this module. See also \secref{operators}.

Compatible to Ciao Prolog, if \arg{Module} is unbound, it is unified
with the basename without extension of the file being loaded.
\end{description}


\section{Importing Predicates into a Module}	\label{sec:import}

Predicates can be added to a module by \jargon{importing} them from
another module. Importing adds predicates to the namespace of a
module. An imported predicate can be called exactly the same as a
locally defined predicate, although its implementation remains part of
the module in which it has been defined.

Importing the predicates from another module is achieved using the
directives use_module/1 or use_module/2. Note that both directives take
\arg{file name(s)} as arguments. I.e., modules are imported based on
their file name rather than their module name.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{use_module}{1}{+Files}
Load the file(s) specified with \arg{File} just like ensure_loaded/1.
The files must all be module files. All exported predicates from the
loaded files are imported into the module from which this predicate is
called. This predicate is equivalent to ensure_loaded/1, except that it
raises an error if \arg{File} is not a module file.

    \predicate{use_module}{2}{+File, +ImportList}
Load \arg{File}, which must be a module file and import the predicates
as specified by \arg{ImportList}. \arg{ImportList} is a list of
predicate indicators specifying the predicates that will be imported
from the loaded module. \arg{ImportList} also allows for renaming or
import-everything-except. See also \const{import} option of
load_files/2. The first example below loads member/2 from the lists
library and append/2 under the name \const{list_concat}, which how this
predicate is named in YAP. The second example loads all exports from
library option, except for meta_options/3. These renaming facilities are
generally used to deal with portability issues with as few as possible
changes to the actual code. See also \secref{dialect} and
\secref{reexport}.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(lists), [ member/2,
				append/2 as list_concat
			      ]).
:- use_module(library(option), except([meta_options/3])).
\end{code}
\end{description}

The module/2 directive, use_module/1 and use_module/2 are sufficient to
partition a simple Prolog program into modules. The SWI-Prolog graphical
cross-referencing tool gxref/0 can be used to analyse the dependencies
between non-module files and propose module declarations for each file.


\section{Defining a meta-predicate}
\label{sec:metapred}

A meta-predicate is a predicate that calls other predicates dynamically,
modifies a predicate or reasons about properties of a predicate. Such
predicates use either a compound term or a \jargon{predicate indicator}
to describe the predicate they address, e.g., \exam{assert(name(jan))}
or \exam{abolish(name/1)}. With modules, this simple schema no longer
works as each module defines its own mapping from name+arity to
predicate. This is resolved by wrapping the original description in a
term <module>:<term>, e.g., \exam{assert(person:name(jan))} or
\exam{abolish(person:name/1)}.

Of course, calling assert/1 from inside a module, we expect to assert to
a predicate local to this module. In other words, we do not wish to
provide this \functor{:}{2} wrapper by hand. The meta_predicate/1
directive tells the compiler that certain arguments are terms that will
be used to lookup a predicate and thus need to be wrapped (qualified)
with <module>:<term>, unless they are already wrapped.

In the example below, we use this to define maplist/3 inside a module.
The argument `2' in the meta_predicate declaration means that the
argument is module sensitive and refers to a predicate with an arity
that is two more than the term that is passed in. The compiler only
distinguishes the values 0..9 and \chr{:}, which denote module-sensitive
arguments, from \chr{+}, \chr{-} and \chr{?} which denotes
\jargon{modes}. The values 0..9 are used by the
\jargon{cross-referencer} and syntax highlighting. Note that the
helper-predicate maplist_/3 does not need to be declared as a
meta-predicate because the maplist/3 wrapper already ensures that
\arg{Goal} is qualified as <module>:\arg{Goal}. See the description of
meta_predicate/1 for details.

\begin{code}
:- module(maplist, [maplist/3]).
:- meta_predicate maplist(2, ?, ?).

%%      maplist(:Goal, +List1, ?List2)
%
%       True if Goal can successfully be applied to all
%	successive pairs of elements from List1 and List2.

maplist(Goal, L1, L2) :-
	maplist_(L1, L2, G).

maplist_([], [], _).
maplist_([H0|T0], [H|T], Goal) :-
	call(Goal, H0, H),
	maplist_(T0, T, Goal).
\end{code}

\begin{description}
    \prefixop{meta_predicate}{+Head, \ldots}
Define the predicates referenced by the comma-separated list \arg{Head}
as \jargon{meta-predicates}. Each argument of each head is a
\jargon{meta argument specifier}. Defined specifiers are given below.
Only 0..9 and \chr{:} are interpreted; the mode declarations \chr{+},
\chr{-} and \chr{?} are ignored.

    \begin{description}
        \termitem{0..9}{}
The argument is a term that is used to reference a predicate
with $N$ more arguments than the given argument term.  For
example: \exam{call(0)} or \exam{maplist(1, +)}.
        \termitem{:}{}
The argument is module sensitive, but does not directly refer
to a predicate.  For example: \exam{consult(:)}.
        \termitem{-}{}
The argument is not module sensitive and unbound on entry.
        \termitem{?}{}
The argument is not module sensitive and the mode is unspecified.
        \termitem{+}{}
The argument is not module sensitive and bound (i.e., nonvar)
on entry.
    \end{description}

Each argument that is module-sensitive (i.e., marked 0..9 or \chr{:}) is
qualified with the context module of the caller if it is not already
qualified. The implementation ensures that the argument is passed as
<module>:<term>, where <atom> is an atom denoting the name of a module
and <term> itself is not a \functor{:}{2} term. Below is a simple
declaration and a number of queries.

\begin{code}
:- meta_predicate
	meta(0, +).

meta(Module:Term, _Arg) :-
	format('Module=~w, Term = ~q~n', [Module, Term]).
\end{code}

\begin{code}
?- meta(test, x).
Module=user, Term = test
?- meta(m1:test, x).
Module=m1, Term = test
?- m2:meta(test, x).
Module=m2, Term = test
?- m1:meta(m2:test, x).
Module=m2, Term = test
?- meta(m1:m2:test, x).
Module=m2, Term = test
?- meta(m1:42:test, x).
Module=42, Term = test
\end{code}

The meta_predicate/1 declaration is the portable mechanism for defining
meta-predicates and replaces the old SWI-Prolog specific mechanism
provided by the deprecated predicates module_transparent/1,
context_module/1 and strip_module/3.  See also \secref{modulecompat}.
\end{description}


\section{Overruling Module Boundaries}       \label{sec:overrule}

The module system described so far is sufficient to distribute programs
over multiple modules. There are however cases in which we would like to
be able to overrule this schema and explicitly call a predicate in some
module or assert explicitly into some module. Calling in a particular
module is useful for debugging from the user's top-level or to access
multiple implementations of the same interface that reside in multiple
modules. Accessing the same interface from multiple modules cannot be achieved
using importing because importing a predicate with the same name and
arity from two modules results in a name conflict. Asserting in a
different module can be used to create models dynamically in a new
module. See \secref{dynamic-modules}.

Direct addressing of modules is achieved using a \functor{:}{2}
explicitly in a program and rely on the module qualification mechanism
described in \secref{metapred}.  Here are a few examples:

\begin{code}
?- assert(world:done).  % asserts done/0 into module world
?- world:assert(done).  % the same
?- world:done.          % calls done/0 in module world
\end{code}


\section{Interacting with modules from the toplevel}
\label{sec:mtoplevel}

Debugging often requires interaction with predicates that reside in
modules: running them, setting spy-points on them, etc. This can be
achieved using the <module>:<term> construct explicitly as described
above. In SWI-Prolog, you may also wish to omit the module
qualification. Setting a spy-point (spy/1) on a plain predicate sets a
spy-point on any predicate with that name in any module. Editing
(edit/1) or calling an unqualified predicate invokes the DWIM (Do What I
Mean) mechanism, which generally suggests the correct qualified query.

Mainly for compatibility, we provide module/1 to switch the module
with which the interactive toplevel interacts:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{module}{1}{+Module}
The call \exam{module(\arg{Module})} may be used to switch the default
working module for the interactive top-level (see prolog/0).  This may
be used when debugging a module. The example below lists the clauses
of {file_of_label}/2 in the module \const{tex}.

\begin{code}
1 ?- module(tex).

Yes
tex: 2 ?- listing(file_of_label/2).
...
\end{code}
\end{description}



\section{Composing modules from other modules}
\label{sec:reexport}

The predicates in this section are intended to create new modules from
the content of other modules. Below is an example to define a
\emph{composite} module.  The example exports all public predicates
of \const{module_1}, \const{module_2} and \const{module_3}, pred/1
from \const{module_4}, all predicates from \const{module_5} except
do_not_use/1 and all predicates from \const{module_6} while renaming
pred/1 into mypred/1.

\begin{code}
:- module(my_composite, []).
:- reexport([ module_1,
	      module_2,
	      module_3
	    ]).
:- reexport(module_4, [ pred/1 ]).
:- reexport(module_5, except([do_not_use/1])).
:- reexport(module_6, except([pred/1 as mypred])).
\end{code}


\begin{description}
    \predicate{reexport}{1}{+Files}
Load and import predicates as use_modules/1 and re-export all imported
predicates. The reexport declarations must immediately follow the module
declaration.

    \predicate{reexport}{2}{+File, +Import}
Import from \arg{File} as use_module/2 and re-export the imported
predicates. The reexport declarations must immediately follow the module
declaration.
\end{description}


\section{Operators and modules}
\label{sec:moduleop}

Operators (\secref{operators}) are local to modules, where the initial
table behaves as if it is copied from the module \const{user} (see
\secref{resmodules}).  A specific operator can be disabled inside a
module using \exam{:- op(0, Type, Name)}.  Inheritance from the public
table can be restored using \exam{:- op(-1, Type, Name)}.

In addition to using the op/3 directive, operators can be declared in
the module/2 directive as shown below. Such operator declarations are
visible inside the module and importing such a module makes the
operators visible in the target module. Exporting operators is typically
used by modules that implement sub-languages such as chr (see
\chapref{chr}). The example below is copied from the library
\pllib{clpfd}.

\begin{code}
:- module(clpfd,
 	  [ op(760, yfx, #<==>),
	    op(750, xfy, #==>),
	    op(750, yfx, #<==),
	    op(740, yfx, #\/),
	    ...
	    (#<==>)/2,
	    (#==>)/2,
	    (#<==)/2,
	    (#\/)/2,
	    ...
	  ]).
\end{code}


\section{Dynamic importing using import modules}
\label{sec:importmodule}

Until now we discussed the public module interface that is, at least to
some extent, portable between Prolog implementation with a module system
that is derived from Quintus Prolog. The remainder of this chapter
describes the underlying mechanisms that can be used to emulate other
module systems or implement other code-reuse mechanisms.

In addition to built-in predicates, imported predicates and locally
defined predicates, SWI-Prolog modules can also call predicates from its
\jargon{import modules}. Each module has a (possibly empty) list of
import modules. In the default setup, each new module has a single
import module, which is \const{user} for all normal user modules and
\const{system} for all system library modules. Module \const{user}
imports from \const{system} where all built-in predicates reside. These
special modules are described in more detail in \secref{resmodules}.

The list of import modules can be manipulated and queried using the
following predicates:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{set_base_module}{1}{:Module}
Set the default import module of the current module to \arg{Module}.
Typically, \arg{Module} is one of \const{user} or \const{system}.

    \predicate{import_module}{2}{+Module, -Import}
True if \arg{Import} is defined as an import module for \arg{Module}.
All normal modules only import from \const{user}, which imports from
\const{system}. The predicates add_import_module/3 and
delete_import_module/2 can be used to manipulate the import list.

    \predicate{add_import_module}{3}{+Module, +Import, +StartOrEnd}
If \arg{Import} is not already an import module for \arg{Module}, add
it to this list at the \const{start} or \const{end} depending on
\arg{StartOrEnd}.  See also import_module/2 and delete_import_module/2.

    \predicate{delete_import_module}{2}{+Module, +Import}
Delete \arg{Import} from the list of import modules for \arg{Module}.
Fails silently if \arg{Import} is not in the list.
\end{description}

One usage scenario of import modules is to define a module that is a
copy of another, but where one or more predicates have an alternative
definition.


\section{Reserved Modules and using the `user' module}
\label{sec:resmodules}

As mentioned above, SWI-Prolog contains two special modules. The first
one is the module \const{system}. This module contains all built-in
predicates. Module \const{system} has no import module. The second
special module is the module \const{user}. This module forms the initial
working space of the user. Initially it is empty. The import module of
module \const{user} is \const{system}, making all built-in predicates
available.

All other modules import from the module \const{user}. This implies they
can use all predicates imported into \const{user} without explicitly
importing them. If an application loads all modules from the
\const{user} module using use_module/1, one achieves a scoping system
similar to the C-language, where every module can access all exported
predicates without any special precautions.


\section{An alternative import/export interface}

The use_module/1 predicate from \secref{import} defines import and
export relations based on the filename from which a module is loaded. If
modules are created differently, such as by asserting predicates into a
new module as described in \secref{dynamic-modules}, this interface
cannot be used. The interface below provides for import/export from
modules that are not created using a module-file.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{export}{1}{+PredicateIndicator, \ldots}
Add predicates to the public list of the context module.  This implies
the predicate will be imported into another module if this module is
imported with use_module/[1,2].  Note that predicates are normally
exported using the directive module/2. export/1 is meant to handle
export from dynamically created modules.

    \predicate{import}{1}{+PredicateIndicator, \ldots}
Import predicates \arg{PredicateIndicator} into the current context
module. \arg{PredicateIndicator} must specify the source module using
the \mbox{<module>:<pi>} construct. Note that predicates are
normally imported using one of the directives use_module/[1,2].
The import/1 alternative is meant for handling imports into dynamically
created modules.  See also export/1 and export_list/2.
\end{description}


\section{Dynamic Modules}               \label{sec:dynamic-modules}

So far, we discussed modules that were created by loading a
module-file.  These modules have been introduced to facilitate the
development of large applications.  The modules are fully defined at
load-time of the application and normally will not change during
execution.  Having the notion of a set of predicates as a
self-contained world can be attractive for other purposes as well.
For example, assume an application that can reason about multiple
worlds.  It is attractive to store the data of a particular world in a
module, so we extract information from a world simply by invoking
goals in this world.

Dynamic modules can easily be created.  Any built-in predicate that
tries to locate a predicate in a specific module will create this
module as a side-effect if it did not yet exist.  For Example:

\begin{code}
?- assert(world_a:consistent),
   world_a:set_prolog_flag(unknown, fail).
\end{code}

These calls create a module called `world_a' and make the call
`world_a:consistent' succeed. Undefined predicates will not raise an
exception for this module (see \prologflag{unknown}).

Import and export from a dynamically created world can be achieved using
import/1 and export/1 or specifying the import module as described in
\secref{importmodule}.

\begin{code}
?- world_b:export(solve(_,_)).          % exports solve/2 from world_b
?- world_c:import(world_b:solve(_,_)).  % and import it to world_c
\end{code}


\section{Transparent predicates: definition and context module}
\label{sec:ctxmodule}

The qualification of module sensitive arguments
described in \secref{metapred} is realised using \jargon{transparent}
predicates.  It is now deprecated to use this mechanism
directly. However, studying the underlying mechanism helps to
understand SWI-Prolog's modules.  In some respect, the transparent
mechanism is more powerful than meta-predicate declarations.

Each predicate of the program is assigned a module, called its
\jargon{definition module}. The definition module of a predicate is
always the module in which the predicate was originally defined. Each
active goal in the Prolog system has a \jargon{context module} assigned
to it.

The context module is used to find predicates for a Prolog term. By
default, the context module is the definition module of the predicate
running the goal. For transparent predicates however, this is the
context module of the goal is inherited from the parent goal. Below, we
implement maplist/3 using the transparent mechanism. The code of
maplist/3 and maplist_/3 is the same as in \secref{metapred}, but now we
must declare both the main predicate and the helper as transparent to avoid
changing the context module when calling the helper.

\begin{code}
:- module(maplist, maplist/3).

:- module_transparent
	maplist/3,
	maplist_/3.

maplist(Goal, L1, L2) :-
	maplist_(L1, L2, G).

maplist_([], [], _).
maplist_([H0|T0], [H|T], Goal) :-
	call(Goal, H0, H),
	maplist_(T0, T, Goal).
\end{code}

Note that \emph{any} call that translates terms into predicates is
subject to the transparent mechanism, not just the terms passed to
module-sensitive arguments. For example, the module below
counts the number of unique atoms returned as bindings for a variable.
It works as expected.  If we use the directive
\exam{:- module_transparent count_atom_results/3.} instead,
atom_result/2 is called wrongly in the module \emph{calling}
count_atom_results/3. This can be solved using strip_module/3 to
create a qualified goal and a non-transparent helper predicate that is
defined in the same module.

\begin{code}
:- module(count_atom_results,
	  count_atom_results/3).
:- meta_predicate count_atom_results(-,0,-).

count_atom_results(A, Goal, Count) :-
	setof(A, atom_result(A, Goal), As), !,
	length(As, Count).
count_atom_results(_, _, 0).

atom_result(Var, Goal) :-
	call(Goal),
	atom(Var).
\end{code}

The following predicates support the module-transparent interface:

\begin{description}
    \directive{module_transparent}{1}{+Preds}
\arg{Preds} is a comma separated list of name/arity pairs (like
dynamic/1).  Each goal associated with a transparent declared predicate
will inherit the \jargon{context module} from its parent goal.

    \predicate{context_module}{1}{-Module}
Unify \arg{Module} with the context module of the current goal.
context_module/1 itself is, of course, transparent.

    \predicate{strip_module}{3}{+Term, -Module, -Plain}
Used in module transparent or meta-predicates to extract the referenced
module and plain term. If \arg{Term} is a module-qualified term, i.e.\
of the format \arg{Module}:\arg{Plain}, \arg{Module} and \arg{Plain}
are unified to these values.  Otherwise, \arg{Plain} is unified to
\arg{Term} and \arg{Module} to the context module.
\end{description}


\section{Query the module system}	\label{sec:manipmodule}

The following predicates can be used to query the module system for
reflexive programming:

\begin{description}
    \predicate[nondet]{current_module}{1}{?Module}
True if \arg{Module} is a currently defined module. This predicate
enumerates all modules, whether loaded from a file or created
dynamically.  Note that modules cannot be destroyed in the current
version of SWI-Prolog.

    \predicate{module_property}{2}{?Module, ?Property}
True if \arg{Property} is a property of \arg{Module}. Defined properties
are:

    \begin{description}
        \termitem{file}{?File}
	True if \arg{Module} was loaded from \arg{File}.
	\termitem{line_count}{-Line}
	True if \arg{Module} was loaded from the N-th line of file.
	\termitem{exports}{-ListOfPredicateIndicators}
	True if \arg{Module} exports the given predicates. Predicate
	indicators are in canonical form (i.e., always using Name/Arity
	and never the DCG form Name//Arity). Future versions may also
	use the DCG form and include public operators. See also
	predicate_property/2.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


\section{Compatibility of the Module System}	\label{sec:modulecompat}

The SWI-Prolog module system is largely derived from the Quintus Prolog
module system, which is also adopted by SICStus, Ciao and YAP.
Originally, the mechanism for defining meta-predicates in SWI-Prolog was
based on the module_transparent/1 directive and strip_module/3. Since
5.7.4 it supports the de-facto standard meta_predicate/1 directive for
implementing meta-predicates, providing much better compatibility.

The support for the meta_predicate/1 mechanism however is considerably
different. On most systems, the \emph{caller} of a meta-predicate is
compiled differently to provide the required <module>:<term>
qualification. This implies that the meta-declaration must be available
to the compiler when compiling code that calls a meta-predicate. In
practice, this implies that other systems pose the following
restrictions on meta-predicates:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Modules that provide meta-predicates for a module to-be-compiled
    must be loaded explicitly by that module.
    \item The meta_predicate directives of exported predicates must follow
    the module/2 directive immediately.
    \item After changing a meta-declaration, all modules that \emph{call}
    the modified predicates need to be recompiled.
\end{itemize}

In SWI-Prolog, meta-predicates are also \jargon{module-transparent} and
qualifying the module sensitive arguments is done inside the
meta-predicate. As a result, the caller need not be aware that it is
calling a meta-predicate and none of the above restrictions hold for
SWI-Prolog. However, code that aims at portability must obey the above
rules.

Other differences are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
If a module does not define a predicate, it is searched for in the
\jargon{import modules}. By default, the import module of any
user-defined module is the \const{user} module. In turn, the
\const{user} module imports from the module \const{system} that provides
all built-in predicates.  The auto-import hierarchy can be changed
using add_import_module/3 and delete_import_module/2.

This mechanisms can be used to realise a simple object oriented system
or hierarchical module system.

    \item
Operator declarations are local to a module and may be exported. In
Quintus and SICStus all operators are global.  YAP and Ciao also use
local operators.  SWI-Prolog provides global operator declarations
from within a module by explicitly qualifying the operator name with
the \const{user} module.

\begin{code}
:- op(precedence, type, user:(operatorname)).
\end{code}
\end{itemize}
