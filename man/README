			SWI-Prolog manual sources


This directory contains the sources to  the SWI-Prolog manual. From this
source we create PDF, HTML and the   plain  text online manual available
through the help/1 and apropos/1 commands.

The *.doc files form the input. The  program doc2tex converts these into
plain LaTeX files. It is responsible   for  handling characters that are
difficult to handle in LaTeX, such as \  and to make references for such
constructs like member/2.

The style file pl.sty ensures _ (underscore) can be used without special
precautions outside math mode.  Do NOT write expand\_file/2, but simply
expand_file/2.


Handling weird characters
-------------------------

Predicate names that cannot be handled by   TeX  due to weird characters
are translated by doc2tex if they appear as plain LaTeX argument. We use
the URL quoting mechanism for this, producing  sequences that can be use
in any TeX environment (unlike \verb). The sequences are named \S<name>.
If you add such a sequence you must:

	* Add it to doc2tex
	* Add it to pl.sty
	* Add it to ../packages/ltx2htm/pl.cmd
	* Add it to ../packages/ltx2htm/pl.pl
	* Run "make install" in ../packages/ltx2html

Summaries
---------

For each described predicate  there  MUST  be   an  entry  in  the  file
summary.doc.  Note  that  the  content   of    this   file   is  ordered
alphabetically.

Documenting libraries
---------------------

Libraries are documented in their own file  in the lib subdirectory. The
library file has to be added to  the input statements of lib/library.doc
and the LIBFILES macro of the Makefile.   The summary of libraries is in
the file lib/summary.doc. Please update   this  with summary information
for your library.

Generating the documentation
----------------------------

You need a recent latex installation,  including pdflatex. We use teTeX.
You also need to install the fixed-width font libraries available in the
txt subdirectory. The README there explains how this must be installed.

For the HTML, you also need to install the Prolog based latex2html. This
is available in ../packages/ltx2html. After   installing Prolog and with
Prolog in your PATH, a simple "make   install" should suffice to install
this in $HOME/bin

Finally, check the Makefile, notably the definition of PL.

Targets:

	make online	- Generate the library/MANUAL file and index
	make pdf	- Generate MANUAL.pdf
	make html	- Generate the HTML version
	make clean	- Remove generated intermediate files.
