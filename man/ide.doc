\chapter{Initialising and Managing a Prolog Project}	\label{sec:IDE}

\index{IDE}\index{Development environment}%
Prolog text-books give you an overview of the Prolog language. The
manual tells you what predicates are provided in the system and what
they do. This chapter wants to explain how to run a project. There is no
ultimate `right' way to do this. Over the years we developed some
practice in this area and SWI-Prolog's commands are there to support
this practice.  This chapter describes the conventions and supporting
commands.

The first two sections (\secref{projectfiles} and \secref{usingmodules}
only require plain Prolog. The remainder discusses the use of the
built-in graphical tools that require the XPCE graphical library
installed on your system.


\section{The project source-files}		\label{sec:projectfiles}

Organisation of source-files depends largely on the size of your
project.  If you are doing exercises for a Prolog course you'll normally
use one file for each exercise.  If you have a small project you'll work
work with one directory holding a couple of files and some files to
link it all together.  Even bigger projects will be organised in
sub-projects each using their own directory.	

\subsection{File Names and Locations}

\subsubsection{File Name Extensions}		\label{sec:fileext}

\index{.pl}\index{.pro}%
The first consideration is what extension to use for the source-files.
Tradition calls for \fileext{pl}, but conflicts with Perl force the use
of another extension on systems where extensions have global meaning,
such as MS-Windows. On such systems \fileext{pro} is the common
alternative.%
    \footnote{On MS-Windows, the alternative extension is stored in
	      the registry-key
	      \const{HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/SWI/Prolog/fileExtension}
	      or
	      \const{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/SWI/Prolog/fileExtension}}

All versions of SWI-Prolog load files with the extension \fileext{pl} as
well as with the registered alternative extension without explicitly
specifying the extension. For portability reasons we propose the
following convention:

\begin{description}
    \item [If there is no conflict] because you do not use a conflicting
application or the system does not force a unique relation between
extension and application, use \fileext{pl}.

    \item [With a conflict] choose \fileext{pro} and use this extension
for the files you want to load through your file-manager. Use
\fileext{pl} for all other files for maximal portability.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Project Directories}

\index{/}\index{\chr{\}}%
Large projects are generally composed of sub-projects, each using their
own directory or directory-structure.  If nobody else will ever touch
your files and you use only one computer there is little to worry about,
but this is rarely the case with a large project.

To improve portability, SWI-Prolog uses the POSIX notation for
filenames, which uses the forward slash (\const{/}) to separate
directories.  Just before hitting the file-system it uses
prolog_to_os_filename/2 to convert the filename to the conventions
used by the hosting operating system.  It is \emph{strongly} advised
to write paths using the \const{/}, especially on systems using the
\chr{\} for this purpose (MS-Windows).  Using \chr{\} violates the
portability rules and requires you to \emph{double} the \chr{\} due
to the Prolog quoted-atom escape rules.

Portable code should use prolog_to_os_filename/2 to convert computed
paths into system-paths when constructing commands for shell/1 and
friends.


\subsubsection{Sub-projects using search-paths}

Thanks to Quintus, Prolog adapted an extensible mechanism for searching
files using file_search_path/2.  This mechanism allows for comfortable
and readable specifications.

Suppose you have extensive library packages on graph-algorithms,
set-operations and ui-primitives. These sub-projects are likely
candidates for re-use in future projects. A good choice is to create a
directory with sub-directories for each of these sub-projects.  

Next, there are three options.  One is to add the sub-projects to the
directory-hierarchy of the current project. Another is to use a
completely dislocated directory and finally the sub-project can
be added to the SWI-Prolog hierarchy.  Using local installation,
a typical file_search_path/2 is:

\begin{code}
:- prolog_load_context(directory, Dir),
   asserta(user:file_search_path(myapp, Dir)).

user:file_search_path(graph, myapp(graph)).
user:file_search_path(ui,    myapp(ui)).
\end{code}

For using sub-projects in the SWI-Prolog hierarchy one should use
the path-alias \const{swi} as basis.  For a system-wide installation
use an absolute-path.

Extensive sub-projects with a small well-defined API should define a
load-file using use_module/1 calls to import the various
library-components and export the API.


\subsection{Project Special Files}

There are a number of tasks you typically carry out on your project,
such as loading it, creating a saved-state, debugging it, etc.  Good
practice on large projects is to define small files that hold the
commands to execute such a task, name this file after the task and
give it a file-extension that makes starting easy (see
\secref{fileext}).  The task \emph{load} is generally central to
these tasks.  Here is a tentative list.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [\file{load.pl}]
Use this file to set up the environment (prolog flags and file search
paths) and load the sources.  Quite commonly this file also provides
convenient predicates to parse command-line options and start the
application.

    \item [\file{run.pl}]
Use this file to start the application. Normally it loads \file{load.pl}
in silent-mode, and calls one of the starting predicates from
\file{load.pl}.

    \item [\file{save.pl}]
Use this file to create	a saved-state of the application by loading
\file{load.pl} and call qsave_program/2 to generate a saved-state with
the proper options.

    \item [\file{debug.pl}]
Loads the program for debugging.  In addition to loading \file{load.pl}
this file defines rules for portray/1 to modify printing rules for
complex terms and customisation rules for the debugger and editing
environment.  It may start some of these tools.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Using modules}				\label{sec:usingmodules}

Modules have been debated fiercely in the Prolog world.  Despite all
counter-arguments we feel they are extremely useful because

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [They hide local predicates]
This is the reason they have been invented in the first place. Hiding
provides two features.  They allow for short predicate names without
worrying about conflicts.  Given the flat name-space introduced
by modules, they still require meaningful module names as well as
meaningful names for exported predicates.

    \item [They document the interface]
Possibly more important then avoiding name-conflicts is their role
in documenting which part of the file is for public usage and which
is private.  When editing a module you may assume you can reorganise
anything but the name and semantics of the exported predicates without
worrying.

    \item [They help the editor]
The PceEmacs built-in editor does on-the-fly cross-referencing of the
current module, colouring predicates based on their origin and usage.
Using modules, the editor can quickly find out what is provided by the
imported modules by reading just the first term.  This allows it to
indicate real-time which predicates are not used or not defined.
\end{itemlist}

Using modules is generally easy.  Only if you write meta-predicates
(predicates reasoning about other predicates) that are exported from
a module good understanding of resolution of terms to predicates inside
a module is required.  Here is a typical example from \pllib{readutil}.

\begin{code}
:- module(read_util,
          [ read_line_to_codes/2,       % +Fd, -Codes
            read_line_to_codes/3,       % +Fd, -Codes, ?Tail
            read_stream_to_codes/2,     % +Fd, -Codes
            read_stream_to_codes/3,     % +Fd, -Codes, ?Tail
            read_file_to_codes/3,       % +File, -Codes, +Options
            read_file_to_terms/3        % +File, -Terms, +Options
          ]).
\end{code}


\section{The test-edit-reload cycle}		\label{sec:editreload}

SWI-Prolog does not enforce the use of a particular editor for writing
down Prolog source code. Editors are complicated programs that must be
mastered in detail for real productive programming and if you are
familiar with a specific editor you should not be forced to change. You
may specify your favourite editor using the prolog flag \const{editor},
the environment variable \env{EDITOR} or by defining rules for
prolog_edit:edit_source/1 (see \secref{listing}).

The use of a built-in editor, which is selected by setting the
prolog-flag \const{editor} to \const{pce_emacs}, has advantages. The
XPCE \class{editor} object around which the built-in PceEmacs is built
can be opened as a Prolog stream allowing analysis of your source by the
real Prolog system.

\subsection{Locating things to edit}

\index{TAB,completion}\index{completion,TAB}%
The central predicate for editing something is edit/1, an extensible
front-end that searches for objects (files, predicates, modules as
well as XPCE classes and methods) in the Prolog database.  If multiple
matches are found it provides a choice.  Together with the built-in
completion on atoms bound to the \const{TAB} key this provides a quick
way to edit objects:

\begin{code}
?- edit(country).
Please select item to edit:

  1 chat:country/10	 '/staff/jan/lib/prolog/chat/countr.pl':16
  2 chat:country/1       '/staff/jan/lib/prolog/chat/world0.pl':72

Your choice? 
\end{code}


\subsection{Editing and incremental compilation}

One of the nice features of Prolog is that the code can be modified
while the program is running. Using pure Prolog you can trace a program,
find it is misbehaving, enter a \jargon{break environment}, modify the
source code, reload it and finally do \emph{retry} on the misbehaving
predicate and try again. This sequence is not uncommon for long-running
programs. For faster programs one normally aborts after understanding
the misbehaviour, edit the source, reload it and try again.

One of the nice features of SWI-Prolog is the availability of make/0,
a simple predicate that checks all loaded source files to see which
ones you have modified.  It then reloads these files, considering the
module from which the file was loaded originally. This greatly
simplifies the trace-edit-verify development cycle.  After the tracer
reveals there is something wrong with prove/3, you do:

\begin{code}
?- edit(prove).
\end{code}

Now edit the source, possibly switching to other files and making
multiple changes.  After finishing invoke make/0, either through
the editor UI (\menu{Compile/Make}{Control-C Control-M}) or on
the toplevel and watch the files being reloaded.%
    \footnote{Watching these files is a good habit.  If expected
	      files are not reloaded you may have forgotten to save
	      them from the editor or you may have been editing the
	      wrong file (wrong directory).}

\begin{code}
?- make.
% show compiled into photo_gallery 0.03 sec, 3,360 bytes
\end{code}


\section{Using the PceEmacs built-in editor}	\label{sec:pceemacs}

\subsection{Activating PceEmacs}

Initially edit/1 uses the editor specified in the \env{EDITOR}
environment variable. There are two ways to force it to use the built-in
editor. One is to set the prolog-flag \const{editor} to
\const{pce_emacs} and the other is by starting the editor explictely
using the emacs/[0,1] predicates.

\subsection{Bluffing through PceEmacs} 	\label{sec:emacsbluff}

PceEmacs closely mimics Richard Stallman's GNU-Emacs commands, adding
features from modern window-based editors to make it more acceptable for
beginners.%
    \footnote{Decent merging with MS-Windows control-key conventions is
	      difficult as many conflict with GNU-Emacs.  Expecially
	      the cut/copy/paste commands conflict with important
	      GNU-Emacs commands.}

At the basis, PceEmacs maps keyboard sequences to methods defined on the
extended \class{editor} object. Some frequently used commands are, with
their key-binding, presented in the menu-bar above each editor window. 
A complete overview of the bindings for the current \jargon{mode} is
provided through \menu{Help/Show key bindings}{Control-h Control-b}.

\subsubsection{Edit modes}

Modes are the heart of (Pce)Emacs. Modes define dedicated editing
support for a particular kind of (source-)text. For our purpose we want
\jargon{Prolog mode}. Their are various ways to make PceEmacs use Prolog
mode for a file.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Using the proper extension]
If the file ends in \fileext{pl} or the selected alternative
(e.g.\ \fileext{pro}) extension, Prolog mode is selected.

    \item [Using \exam{\#!/path/to/pl}]
If the file is a \jargon{Prolog Script} file, starting with the line
\exam{\#!/path/to/pl options -s}, Prolog mode is selected regardless
of the extension

    \item [Using \exam{-*- Prolog -*-}]
If the above sequence appears in the first line of the file (inside a
Prolog comment) Prolog mode is sequence

    \item [Explicit selection]
Finally, using \menu{File/Mode/Prolog} you can switch to Prolog mode
explicitly.
\end{itemlist}

\subsubsection{Frequently used editor commands}

Below we list a few important commands and how to activate them.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Cut/Copy/Paste]
These commands follow Unix/X11 traditions.  You're best suited with
a three-button mouse. After selecting using the left-mouse (double-click
uses word-mode and triple line-mode), the selected text is
\emph{automatically} copied to the clipboard (X11 primary selection on
Unix). \emph{Cut} is achieved using the \key{DEL} key or by typing
something else at the location.  \emph{Paste} is achieved using the
middle-mouse (or wheel) button. If you don't have a middle mouse-button,
pressing the left- and right-button at the same time is interpreted as
a middle-button click. If nothing helps there is the \menu{Edit/Paste}{}
menu-entry.  Text is pasted at the caret-location.

    \item [Undo]
Undo is bound to the GNU-Emacs \key{Control-_} as well as the MS-Windows
\key{Control-Z} sequence.

    \item [Abort]
Multi-key sequences can be aborted at any stage using \key{Control-G}.

    \item [Find]
Find (Search) is started using \key{Control-S} (forward) or
\key{Control-R} (backward). PceEmacs implements \jargon{incremental
search}.  This is difficult to use for novices, but very powerful once
you get the clue. After one of the above start-keys the system indicates
search mode in the status line. As you are typing the search-string, the
system searches for it, extending the search with every character you
type.  It illustrates the current match using a green background.

If the target cannot be found, PceEmacs warns you and no longer
extends the search-string.%
    \footnote{GNU-Emacs keeps extending the string, but why?  Adding
	      more text will not make it match.}
During search some characters have special meaning.  Typing anything but
these characters commits the search, re-starting normal edit mode.
Special commands are:

\begin{description}
    \definition{\key{Control-S}}
Search for next forwards.
    \definition{\key{Control-R}}
Search for next backwards.
    \definition{\key{Control-W}}
Extend search to next word-boundary.
    \definition{\key{Control-G}}
Cancel search, go back to where it started.
    \definition{\key{ESC}}
Commit search, leaving caret at found location.
    \definition{\key{Backspace}}
Remove a character from the search string.
\end{description}

    \item [Dynamic Abbreviation]
Also called \jargon{dabbrev} is an important feature of Emacs clones
to support programming.  After typing the first few letters of an
identifier you may hit \key{Alt-/}, causing PceEmacs to search backwards
for identifiers that start the same and using it to complete the text
you typed.  A second \key{Alt-/} searches further backwards.  If there
are no hits before the caret it starts searching forwards.  With some
practice, this system allows for very fast entering code with nice and
readable identifiers (or other difficult long words).

    \item [Open (a file)]
Is called \menu{File/Find file}{Control-x Control-f}.  By default the 
file is loaded into the current window. If you want to keep this window,
Hit \key{Alt-s} or click the little icon at the bottom-left to make the
window \jargon{sticky}.

    \item [Split view]
Sometimes you want to look at two places of the same file.  To do this,
use \key{Control-x 2} to create a new window pointing to the same file.
Do not worry, you can edit as well as move around in both.
\key{Control-x 1} kills all other windows running on the same file.
\end{itemlist}

These were the most commonly used commands. In section
\secref{emacsprologmode} we discuss specific support for dealing
with Prolog source code.


\subsection{Prolog Mode}		\label{sec:emacsprologmode}

In the previous section (\secref{emacsbluff}) we explained the basics of
PceEmacs. Here we continue with Prolog specific functionality. Possibly
the most interesting is \jargon{Syntax highlighting}. Unlike most
editors where this is based on simple patterns, PceEmacs syntax
highlighting is achieved by Prolog itself actually reading and
interpreting the source as you type it.  There are three moments at
which PceEmacs checks (part of) the syntax.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [After typing a \chr{.}]
After typing a \chr{.} that is not preceeded by a \jargon{symbol}
character the system assumes you completed a clause, tries to find the
start of this clause and verifies the syntax. If this process succeeds
it colours the elements of the clause according to the rules given
below. Colouring is done using information from the last full check on
this file. If it fails, the syntax error is displayed in the status line
and the clause is not coloured.

    \item [After the command \key{Control-c Control-s}]
Acronym for \textbf{C}check \textbf{S}yntax it performs the same
checks as above for the clause surrounding the caret. On a syntax error
however, the caret is moved to the expected location of the error.%
\footnote{In most cases the location where the parser cannot proceed is
further down the file than the actual error-location.}

    \item [After pausing for two seconds]
After a short pause (2 seconds), PceEmacs opens the edit-buffer and
reads it as a whole, creating an index of defined, called, dynamic,
imported and exported predicates.  After completing this, it re-reads
the file and colours all clauses and calls with valid syntax.  

    \item [After typing \key{Control-l Control-l}]
The \key{Control-l} commands re-centers the window (scrolls the window
to make the caret the center of the window).  Hitting this command twice
starts the same process as above.
\end{itemlist}

\paragraph{The colour schema} itself is defined in
\pllib{emacs/prolog_colour}. The colouring can be extended and modified
using multifile predicates. Please check this source-file for details.
In general, underlined objects have a popup (right-mouse button)
associated for common commands such as viewing the documentation or
source. {\bf Bold} text is used to indicate the definition of objects
(typically predicates when using plain Prolog). Other colours follow
intuitive conventions.  See \tabref{plcolour}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Clauses} \\
\hline
Blue bold	& Head of an exported predicate \\
Red bold	& Head of a predicate that is not called \\
Black Bold	& Head of remaining predicates \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Calls in the clause-body} \\
\hline
Blue		& Call to built-in or imported predicate \\
Red		& Call to not-defined predicate \\
Purple		& Call to dynamic predicate \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Other entities} \\
\hline
Dark green	& Comment \\
Dark blue	& Quoted atom or string \\
Brown		& Variable \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:plcolour}
\caption{Colour conventions}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Layout support}

Layout is not `just nice', it is \emph{essential} for writing readable
code.  There is much debate on the proper layout of Prolog.  PceEmacs,
being a rather small project supports only one particular style for
layout.%
	\footnote{Defined in Prolog in the file \pllib{emacs/prolog_mode},
		  you may wish to extend this.  Please contribute your
		  extensions!}
Below are examples of typical constructs.

\begin{code}
head(arg1, arg2).

head(arg1, arg2) :- !.

head(Arg1, arg2) :- !,
	call1(Arg1).

head(Arg1, arg2) :-
	(   if(Arg1)
	->  then
	;   else
	).

head(Arg1) :-
	(   a
	;   b
	).

head :-
	a(many,
	  long,
	  arguments(with,
		    many,
		    more),
	  and([ a,
		long,
		list,
		with,
		a,
	      | tail
	      ])).
\end{code}

PceEmacs uses the same conventions as GNU-Emacs. The \key{TAB} key
indents the current line according to the syntax rules.  \key{Alt-q}
indents all lines of the current clause.  It provides support for head,
calls (indented 1 tab), if-then-else, disjunction and argument-lists
broken across multiple lines as illustrated above.


\subsubsection{Finding your way around}

The command \key{Alt-.} extracts name and arity from the caret location
and jumps (after conformation or edit) to the definition of the
predicate.  It does so based on the source-location database of loaded
predicates also used by edit/1. This makes locating predicates
reliable if all sources are loaded and up-to-date (see make/0).

In addition, references to files in use_module/[1,2], consult/1, etc.
are red if the file cannot be found and underlined blue if the file
can be loaded.  A popup allows for opening the referenced file.


\section{The Graphical Debugger}	\label{sec:guitracer}

SWI-Prolog offers two debuggers.  One is the traditional text-console
based 4-port Prolog tracer and the other is a window-based source-level
debugger. The window-based debugger requires XPCE installed. It operates
based on the prolog_trace_interception/4 hook and other low-level
functionality described in \chapref{hack}.

Window-based tracing provides much better overview due to the eminent 
relation to your source-code, a clear list of named variables and their
bindings as well as a graphical overview of the call and choice-point
stack. There are some drawbacks though. Using a textual trace on the
console one can scroll back and examine the past, while the graphical
debugger just presents a (much better) overview of the current state.


\subsection{Invoking the window-based debugger}

Whether the text-based or window-based debugger is used is controlled
using the predicates guitracer/0 and noguitracer/0.  Entering debug
mode is controlled using the normal predicates for this: trace/0 and
spy/1.  In addition, PceEmacs prolog mode provides the command
\menu{Prolog/Break at}{Control-c b} to insert a break-point at a
specific location in the source-code.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{guitracer}{0}{}
This predicate installs the above-mentioned hooks that redirect tracing
to the window-based environment. No window appears. The debugger window
appears as actual tracing is started through trace/0, by hitting a
spy-point defined by spy/1 or a break-point defined using PceEmacs
command \menu{Prolog/Break at}{Control-c b}.

    \predicate{noguitracer}{0}{}
Disable the hooks installed by guitracer/0, reverting to normal
text-console based tracing.
\end{description}

\section{The Prolog Navigator}		\label{sec:navigator}

Another tool is the \jargon{Prolog Navigator}.  This tool can be started
from PceEmacs using the command \menu{Browse/Prolog navigator}{}, from
the GUI debugger or using the programmatic IDE interface described in
\secref{idepreds}.


\section{Accessing the IDE from your program}	\label{sec:idepreds}

Over the years a collection of IDE components have been developed,
each with their own interface.  In addition, some of these components
require each other and loading IDE components must be on demand to
avoid the IDE being part of a saved-state (see qsave_program/2).
For this reason, access to the IDE will be concentrated on a
single interface called prolog_ide/1:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{prolog_ide}{1}{+Action}
This predicate ensures the IDE enabling XPCE component is loaded,
creates the XPCE class \class{prolog_ide} and sends \arg{Ation}
to its one and only instance \verb$@prolog_ide$.  \arg{Action} is one
of the following:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{open_navigator}{+Directory}
Open the Prolog Navigator (see \secref{navigator}) in the given
\arg{Directory}.

    \termitem{open_debug_status}{}
Open a window to edit spy- and trace-points.

    \termitem{open_query_window}{}
Opens a little window to run Prolog queries from a GUI component.
\end{description}
\end{description}


\section{Summary of the iDE}		\label{sec:idesummary}

The SWI-Prolog development environment consists of a number of
interrelated but not (yet) integrated tools.  Here is a list of the most
important features and tips.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Atom completion]
The console%
	\footnote{On Windows this is realised by plwin.exe, on Unix
		  through the GNU readline library, which is included
		  automatically when found by \program{configure}.}
completes a partial atom on the \key{TAB} key and shows alternatives
on the command \key{Alt-?}.

    \item [Use edit/1 to finding locations]
The command edit/1 takes the name of a file, module, predicate or other
entity registered through extensions and starts the users preferred
editor at the right location.

    \item [Select editor]
External editors are selected using the \env{EDITOR} environment
variable, by setting the prolog flag \const{editor} or by defining the
hook prolog_edit:edit_source/1.

    \item [Update Prolog after editing]
Using make/0, all files you have edited are re-loaded.

    \item [PceEmacs]
Offers syntax-highlighting and checking based on real-time parsing of
the editor's buffer, layout-support and navigation support.

    \item [Using the graphical debugger]
The predicates guitracer/0 and noguitracer/0 switch between traditional
text-based and window-based debugging.  The tracer is activated using
the trace/0, spy/1 or menu-items from PceEmacs or the PrologNavigator.

    \item [The Prolog Navigator]
Shows the file-structure and structure inside the file.  It allows for
loading files, editing, setting spy-points, etc.
\end{itemlist}
