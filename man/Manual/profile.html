<H2><A NAME="sec:4.40">4.40 Execution profiling</A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:profile"></A>

<P>This section describes the hierarchical execution profiler introduced 
in SWI-Prolog 5.1.10. This profiler is based on ideas from <B>gprof</B> 
described in <CITE><A HREF="Bibliography.html#graham82gprof">Graham <EM>et 
al.</EM>, 1982</A></CITE>. The profiler consists of two parts: the 
information-gathering is built into the kernel,<A NAME=back-to-note-70 HREF="Notes.html#note-70"> (70)</A> 
and a presentation component which is defined in the <CODE>library(statistics)</CODE> 
library. The latter can be hooked, which is used by the XPCE module
<CODE>library(swi/pce_profile)</CODE> to provide an interactive 
graphical representation of results.

<H3><A NAME="sec:4.40.1">4.40.1 Profiling predicates</A></H3>

<P>Currently, the interface is kept compatible with the old profiler. As 
experience grows, it is likely that the old interface is replaced with 
one that better reflects the new capabilities. Feel free to examine the 
internal interfaces and report useful application thereof.

<A NAME="sec:pceprofile"></A>

<P>Browsing the annotated call-tree as described in <A HREF="profile.html">section 
4.40.3</A> itself is not very attractive. Therefore, the results are 
combined per predicate, collecting all <EM>callers</EM> and and <EM>callees</EM> 
as well as the propagation of time and activations in both directions.
<A HREF="profile.html#fig:profnode">Figure 5</A> illustrates this. The 
central yellowish line is the `current' predicate with counts for time 
spent in the predicate (`Self'), time spent in its children 
(`Siblings'), activations through the call and redo ports. Above that 
are the <EM>callers</EM>. Here, the two time fields indicate how much 
time is spent serving each of the callers. The columns sum to the time 
in the yellowish line. The caller
<EM><VAR>&lt;</VAR>recursive<VAR>&gt;</VAR></EM> are the number of 
recursive calls. Below the yellowish lines are the callees, with the 
time spent in the callee itself for serving the current predicate and 
the time spent in the callees of the callee ('Siblings'), so the whole 
time-block adds up to the `Siblings' field of the current predicate. The 
`Access' fields show how many times the current predicate accesses each 
of the callees.

<P>The predicates have a menu that allows changing the view of the 
detail window to the given caller or callee, showing the documentation 
(if it is a built-in) and/or jumping to the source.

<P>The statistics shown in the report-field of <A HREF="profile.html#fig:profnode">figure

<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>samples</I><BR>
Number of times the call-tree was sampled for collecting time 
statistics. On most hardware the resolution of <CODE>SIGPROF</CODE> is 
1/100 second. This number must be sufficiently large to get reliable 
timing figures. The <B>Time</B> menu allows viewing time as samples, 
relative time or absolute time.

<P>
<LI><I>sec</I><BR>
Total user CPU time with the profiler active.

<P>
<LI><I>predicates</I><BR>
Total count of predicates that have been called at least one time during 
the profile.

<P>
<LI><I>nodes</I><BR>
Number of nodes in the call-tree.

<P>
<LI><I>distortion</I><BR>
How much of the time is spend building the call-tree as a percentage of 
the total execution time. Timing samples while the profiler is building 
the call-tree are not added to the call-tree.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="sec:4.40.3">4.40.3 Information gathering</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:profilegather"></A>

<P>While the program executes under the profiler, the system builds a
<EM>dynamic</EM> call-tree. It does this using three hooks from the 
kernel: one that starts a new goal (<EM>profCall</EM>), one the tells 
the system which goal is resumed after an <EM>exit</EM> (<EM>profExit</EM>) 
and one that tells the system which goal is resumed after a <EM>fail</EM> 
(i.e. which goal is used to <EM>retry</EM> (<EM>profRedo</EM>)). The 
profCall() function finds or creates the subnode for the argument 
predicate below the current node, increments the call-count of this link 
and returns the sub-node which is recorded in the Prolog stack-frame. 
Choice-points are marked with the current profiling node. profExit() and 
profRedo() pass the profiling node where execution resumes.

<P>Just using the above algorithm would create a much too big tree due 
to recursion. For this reason the system performs detection of 
recursion. In the simplest case, recursive procedures increment the 
`recursive' count on the current node. Mutual recursion however is not 
easily detected. For example, <A NAME="idx:call1:1038"></A><A HREF="metacall.html#call/1">call/1</A> 
can call a predicate that uses <A NAME="idx:call1:1039"></A><A HREF="metacall.html#call/1">call/1</A> 
itself. This can be viewed as a recursive invocation, but this is 
generally not desirable. Recursion is currently assumed if the same 
predicate <EM>with the same parent</EM> appears higher in the 
call-graph. Early experience with a some arbitrary non-trivial programs 
are promising.

<P>The last part of the profiler collects statistics on the CPU-time 
used in each node. On systems providing setitimer() with
<CODE>SIGPROF</CODE>, it `ticks' the current node of the call-tree each 
time the timer fires. On Windows a MM-timer in a separate thread checks 
100 times per second how much time is spent in the profiled thread and 
adds this to the current node. See <A HREF="profile.html">section 
4.40.3.1</A> for details.

<H4><A NAME="sec:4.40.3.1">4.40.3.1 Profiling in the Windows 
Implementation</A></H4>

<A NAME="sec:winprofile"></A>

<P>Profiling in the Windows version is similar but as profiling is a 
statistical process it is good to be aware of the implementation<A NAME=back-to-note-71 HREF="Notes.html#note-71"> (71)</A> 
for proper interpretation of the results.

<P>Windows does not provide timers that fire asynchronously, frequent 
and proportional to the CPU time used by the process. Windows does 
provide multi-media timers that can run at high frequency. Such timers 
however run in a separate thread of execution and they are fired on the 
wall-clock rather than the amount of CPU time used. The profiler 
installs such a timer running, for saving CPU time, rather inaccurately 
at about 100 Hz. Each time it is fired, it determines the milliseconds 
CPU time used by Prolog since the last time it was fired. If this value 
is non-zero, active predicates are incremented with this value.
