<P>Prolog threads can exchange data using dynamic predicates, database 
records, and other globally shared data. These provide no suitable means 
to wait for data or a condition as they can only be checked in an 
expensive polling loop. <EM>Message queues</EM> provide a means for 
threads to wait for data or conditions without using the CPU.

<P>Each thread has a message-queue attached to it that is identified by 
the thread. Additional queues are created using

Any term can be placed in a message queue, but note that the term is 
copied to the receiving thread and variable-bindings are thus lost. This 
call returns immediately.

<P>If more than one thread is waiting for messages on the given queue 
and at least one of these is waiting with a partially instantiated
<VAR>Term</VAR>, the waiting threads are <EM>all</EM> sent a wake-up 
signal, starting a rush for the available messages in the queue. This 
behaviour can seriously harm performance with many threads waiting on 
the same queue as all-but-the-winner perform a useless scan of the 
queue. If there is only one waiting thread or all waiting threads wait 
with an unbound variable an arbitrary thread is restarted to scan the

<P>Explicit message queues are designed with the <EM>worker-pool</EM> 
model in mind, where multiple threads wait on a single queue and pick up 
the first goal to execute. Below is a simple implementation where the 
workers execute arbitrary Prolog goals. Note that this example provides 
no means to tell when all work is done. This must be realised using 
additional synchronisation.

<H3><A NAME="sec:8.3.2"><SPAN class="sec-nr">8.3.2</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Signalling 
threads</SPAN></A></H3>

<P>These predicates provide a mechanism to make another thread execute 
some goal as an <EM>interrupt</EM>. Signalling threads is safe as these 
interrupts are only checked at safe points in the virtual machine. 
Nevertheless, signalling in multi-threaded environments should be 
handled with care as the receiving thread may hold a <EM>mutex</EM> (see 
with_mutex). Signalling probably only makes sense to start debugging 
threads and to cancel no-longer-needed threads with <A NAME="idx:throw1:1307"></A><A class="pred" href="exception.html#throw/1">throw/1</A>, 
where the receiving thread should be designed carefully do handle 
exceptions at any point.

<DL>
<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="thread_signal/2"><STRONG>thread_signal</STRONG>(<VAR>+ThreadId, 
:Goal</VAR>)</A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
Make thread <VAR>ThreadId</VAR> execute <VAR>Goal</VAR> at the first 
opportunity. In the current implementation, this implies at the first 
pass through the <EM>Call-port</EM>. The predicate <A NAME="idx:threadsignal2:1308"></A><A class="pred" href="threadcom.html#thread_signal/2">thread_signal/2</A> 
itself places <VAR>Goal</VAR> into the signalled-thread's signal queue 
and returns immediately.

<P>Signals (interrupts) do not cooperate well with the world of 
multi-threading, mainly because the status of mutexes cannot be 
guaranteed easily. At the call-port, the Prolog virtual machine holds no 
locks and therefore the asynchronous execution is safe.

<P><VAR>Goal</VAR> can be any valid Prolog goal, including <A NAME="idx:throw1:1309"></A><A class="pred" href="exception.html#throw/1">throw/1</A> 
to make the receiving thread generate an exception and <A NAME="idx:trace0:1310"></A><A class="pred" href="debugger.html#trace/0">trace/0</A> 
to start tracing the receiving thread.

<P>In the Windows version, the receiving thread immediately executes the 
signal if it reaches a Windows GetMessage() call, which generally 
happens of the thread is waiting for (user-)input.

<H3><A NAME="sec:8.3.3"><SPAN class="sec-nr">8.3.3</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Threads 
and dynamic predicates</SPAN></A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:threadlocal"></A>

<P>Besides queues (<A class="sec" href="threadcom.html">section 8.3.1</A>) 
threads can share and exchange data using dynamic predicates. The 
multi-threaded version knows about two types of dynamic predicates. By 
default, a predicate declared
<EM>dynamic</EM> (see <A NAME="idx:dynamic1:1311"></A><A class="pred" href="dynamic.html#dynamic/1">dynamic/1</A>) 
is shared by all threads. Each thread may assert, retract and run the 
dynamic predicate. Synchronisation inside Prolog guarantees the 
consistency of the predicate. Updates are
<EM>logical</EM>: visible clauses are not affected by assert/retract 
after a query started on the predicate. In many cases primitive from
<A class="sec" href="threadsync.html">section 8.4</A> should be used to 
ensure application invariants on the predicate are maintained.

<P>Besides shared predicates, dynamic predicates can be declared with 
the
<A NAME="idx:threadlocal1:1312"></A><A class="pred" href="threadcom.html#thread_local/1">thread_local/1</A> 
directive. Such predicates share their attributes, but the clause-list 
is different in each thread.

<DL>
<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="thread_local/1"><STRONG>thread_local</STRONG> <VAR>+Functor/+Arity, \ldots</VAR></A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
This directive is related to the <A NAME="idx:dynamic1:1313"></A><A class="pred" href="dynamic.html#dynamic/1">dynamic/1</A> 
directive. It tells the system that the predicate may be modified using <A NAME="idx:assert1:1314"></A><A class="pred" href="db.html#assert/1">assert/1</A>, <A NAME="idx:retract1:1315"></A><A class="pred" href="db.html#retract/1">retract/1</A>, 
etc. during execution of the program. Unlike normal shared dynamic data 
however each thread has its own clause-list for the predicate. As a 
thread starts, this clause list is empty. If there are still clauses as 
the thread terminates these are automatically reclaimed by the system 
(see also <A NAME="idx:volatile1:1316"></A><A class="pred" href="runtime.html#volatile/1">volatile/1</A>). 
The thread_local property implies the properties dynamic and volatile.

<P>Thread-local dynamic predicates are intended for maintaining 
thread-specific state or intermediate results of a computation.

<P>It is not recommended to put clauses for a thread-local predicate 
into a file as in the example below as the clause is only visible from 
the thread that loaded the source-file. All other threads start with an 
empty clause-list.

<PRE class="code">
:- thread_local
        foo/1.

foo(gnat).
</PRE>

<P><B>DISCLAIMER</B> Whether or not this declaration is appropriate in 
the sense of the proper mechanism to reach the goal is still debated. If 
you have strong feeling in favour or against, please share them in the 
SWI-Prolog mailing list.
