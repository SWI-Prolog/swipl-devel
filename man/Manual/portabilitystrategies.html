<H2><A NAME="sec:C.1"><SPAN class="sec-nr">C.1</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Some 
considerations for writing portable code</SPAN></A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:portabilitystrategies"></A>

<P>The traditional way to write portable code is to define custom 
predicates for all potentially non-portable code and define these 
separately for all Prolog dialects one wishes to support. Here are some 
considerations.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Probably the best reason for this is that it allows to define 
minimal semantics required by the application for the portability 
predicates. Such functionality can often be mapped efficiently to the 
target dialect. Contrary, if code was written for dialect <VAR>X</VAR>, 
the defined semantics are those of dialect <VAR>X</VAR>. Emulating all 
extreme cases and full error handling compatibility may be tedious and 
result in a much slower implementation that needed. Take for example
<A NAME="idx:callcleanup2:1583"></A><A class="pred" href="metacall.html#call_cleanup/2">call_cleanup/2</A>. 
The SICStus definition is fundamentally different from the SWI 
definition, but 99% of the applications just want to make calls like 
below to guarantee <VAR>StreamIn</VAR> is closed, even if <SPAN class="pred-ext">process/1</SPAN> 
misbehaves.

<PRE class="code">
        call_cleanup(process(StreamIn), close(In))
</PRE>

<P>
<LI>As a drawback, the code becomes full of <I>my_call_cleanup</I>, etc. and 
every potential portability conflict needs to be abstracted. It is hard 
for people who have to maintain such code later to grasp the exact 
semantics of the <I>my_*</I> predicates and applications that combine 
multiple libraries using this compatibility approach are likely to 
encounter conflicts between the portability layers. A good start is not 
to use <I>my_*</I>, but a prefix derived from the library or application 
name or names that explain the intended semantics more precisely.

<P>
<LI>Another problem is that most code is initially not written with 
portability in mind. Instead, ports are requested by users or arise from 
the desire to switch Prolog dialect. Typically, we want to achieve 
compatibility with the new Prolog dialect with minimal changes, often 
keeping compatibility with the original dialect(s). This problem is well 
known from the C/Unix world and we advice anyone to study the philosophy 
of
<A class="url" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU autoconf</A>, 
from which we will illustrate some highlights below.
</UL>

<P>The GNU autoconf suite, known to most people as <B>configure</B>, was 
an answer to the frustrating life of Unix/C programmers when Unix 
dialects were about as abundant and poorly standardised as Prolog 
dialects today. Writing a portable C program can only be achieved using 
cpp, the C preprocessor. The C preprocessor performs two tasks: macro 
expansion and conditional compilation. Prolog realises macro expansion 
through <A NAME="idx:termexpansion2:1584"></A><A class="pred" href="consulting.html#term_expansion/2">term_expansion/2</A> 
and <A NAME="idx:goalexpansion2:1585"></A><A class="pred" href="consulting.html#goal_expansion/2">goal_expansion/2</A>. 
Conditional compilation is achieved using <CODE>:- if(Condition)</CODE> 
as explained in
<A class="sec" href="consulting.html">section 4.3.1.1</A>. The situation 
appears similar.

<P>The important lesson learned from GNU autoconf is that the <EM>last</EM> 
resort for conditional compilation to achieve portability is to switch 
on the platform or dialect. Instead, GNU autoconf allows you to write 
tests for specific properties of the platform. Most of these are whether 
or not some function or file is available. Then there are some standard 
tests for difficult-to-write-portable situations and finally there is a 
framework that allows you to write arbitrary C programs and check 
whether they can be compiled and/or whether they show the intended 
behaviour. Using a separate <B>configure</B> program is needed in C, as 
you cannot perform C compilation step or run C programs from the C 
preprocessor. In most Prolog environments we do not need this 
distinction as the compiler is integrated into the runtime environment 
and Prolog has excelent reflexion capabilities.

<P>We must learn from the distinction to test for features instead of 
platform (dialect), as this makes the platform specific code robust for 
future changes of the dialect. Suppose we need <A NAME="idx:compare3:1586"></A><A class="pred" href="compare.html#compare/3">compare/3</A> 
as defined in this manual. The <A NAME="idx:compare3:1587"></A><A class="pred" href="compare.html#compare/3">compare/3</A> 
predicate is not part of the ISO standard, but many systems support it 
and it is not unlikely it will become ISO standard or the intended 
dialect will start supporting it. GNU autoconf strongly advises to test 
for the availability:

<PRE class="code">
:- if(\+current_predicate(_, compare(_,_,_))).
compare(&lt;, Term1, Term2) :-
        Term1 @&lt; Term2, !.
compare(&gt;, Term1, Term2) :-
        Term1 @&gt; Term2, !.
compare(=, Term1, Term2) :-
        Term1 == Term2.
:- endif.
</PRE>

<P>This code is <B>much</B> more robust against changes to the intended 
dialect and, possible at least as important, will provide compatibility 
to dialects you didn't even consider porting to right now.

<P>In a more challenging case, the target Prolog has <A NAME="idx:compare3:1588"></A><A class="pred" href="compare.html#compare/3">compare/3</A>, 
but the semantics are different. What to do? One option is to write a
<A NAME="idx:mycompare3:1589"></A><SPAN class="pred-ext">my_compare/3</SPAN> 
and change all occurrences in the code. Alternatively you can rename 
calls using <A NAME="idx:goalexpansion2:1590"></A><A class="pred" href="consulting.html#goal_expansion/2">goal_expansion/2</A> 
like below. This construct will not only deal with Prolog dialects 
lacking compare as well as those that only implement it for numeric 
comparison or have changed the argument order. Of course, writing 
rock-solid code would require a complete test-suite, but this example 
will probably cover all Prolog dialects that allow for conditional 
compilation, have core ISO facilities and provide <A NAME="idx:goalexpansion2:1591"></A><A class="pred" href="consulting.html#goal_expansion/2">goal_expansion/2</A>, 
the things we claim a Prolog dialect should have to start writing 
portable code for it.

<PRE class="code">
:- if(\+catch(compare(&lt;,a,b), _, fail)).
compare_standard_order(&lt;, Term1, Term2) :-
        Term1 @&lt; Term2, !.
compare_standard_order(&gt;, Term1, Term2) :-
        Term1 @&gt; Term2, !.
compare_standard_order(=, Term1, Term2) :-
        Term1 == Term2.

goal_expansion(compare(Order, Term1, Term2),
               compare_standard_order(Order, Term1, Term2)).
:- endif.
</PRE>
