\chapter{SWI-Prolog License Conditions and Tools}
\label{sec:license}

SWI-Prolog licensing aims at a large audience, combining ideas from the
\url[Free Software Foundation]{http://www.fsf.org} and the less
principal \url[Open Source Initiative]{http://www.opensource.org}. The
license aims at:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
Make SWI-Prolog itself and its libraries are `As free as possible'.

    \item
Allow for easy integration of contributions.  See \secref{contrib}.

    \item
Free software can build on SWI-Prolog without limitations.

    \item
Non-free (open or proprietary) software can be produced using
SWI-Prolog, although contributed pure
\url[GPL-ed]{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html} components
cannot be used.
\end{itemize}

To achieve this, different parts of the system have different licenses.
SWI-Prolog programs consists of a mixture of `native' code (source compiled
to machine instructions) and `virtual machine' code (Prolog source compiled to
SWI-Prolog virtual machine instructions, covering both compiled SWI-Prolog
libraries and your compiled application).

For maximal coherence between free licenses, we start with the two prime
licenses from the Free Software Foundation, the
\url[GNU General Public License]{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html}
(GPL) and the
\url[Lesser GNU General Public License]{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html}
(LGPL),
after which we add a proven (used by the GNU-C compiler runtime library
as well as the GNU \emph{ClassPath} project) exception to deal with the
specific nature of compiled virtual machine code in a saved state.


\section{The SWI-Prolog kernel and foreign libraries} \label{sec:clicense}

The SWI-Prolog kernel and our foreign libraries are distributed under
the %href(lgpl, Lesser GNU Public License), also called the
\textbf{LGPL}. A Prolog executable consists of the combination of these
`native' code components and Prolog virtual machine code. The SWI-Prolog
\program{plrc} utility allows for disassembling and re-assembling these
parts, a process satisfying article \textbf{6b} of the LGPL.

Under the LGPL SWI-Prolog can be linked to code distributed under
arbitrary licenses, provided a number of requirements are fullfilled.
The most important requirement is that, if an application replies on a
\emph{modified} version of SWI-Prolog, the modified sources must
be made available.


\subsection{The SWI-Prolog Prolog libraries}

Lacking a satisfactory technical solution to handle article \textbf{6} of the
LGPL, this license cannot be used for the Prolog source code that is part
of the SWI-Prolog system (both libraries and kernel code).  This situation
is comparable to \file{libgcc}, the runtime library used
with the GNU C-compiler. Therefore, we use the same proven license terms
as this library. The libgcc license is the %href(gpl, GPL), accompanied
with a special exception. Below we rephrased this exception adjusted to
our needs:

\begin{quote}\it
As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
compiled with a Free Software compiler, to produce an executable, this
library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered
by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however
invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
the GNU General Public License.
\end{quote}


\section{Contributing to the SWI-Prolog project}	\label{sec:contrib}

To achieve maximal coherence using SWI-Prolog for Free and Non-Free
software we advice the use of the LGPL for contributed foreign code and
the use of the GPL with SWI-Prolog exception for Prolog code for
contributed modules.

As a rule of thumb it is advised to use the above licenses whenever possible
and only use a strict GPL compliant license only if the module contains other
code under strict GPL compliant licenses.


\section{Software support to keep track of license conditions}
\label{sec:softlicense}

Given the above, it is possible that SWI-Prolog packages and extensions
will rely on the GPL.%
    \footnote{On the Unix version, the default toplevel uses the
	      GNU readline library for command-line editing.  This
	      library is distributed under the GPL.  In practice this
	      problem is small as most final applications have Prolog
	      embedded, without direct access to the commandline and
	      therefore without need for \file{libreadline}.}
The predicates below allow for registering license requirements for
Prolog files and foreign modules.  The predicate eval_license/0 reports
which components from the currenly configured system are distributed
under copy-left and open source enforcing licenses (the GPL) and
therefore must be replaced before distributing linked applications
under non-free license conditions.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{eval_license}{0}{}
Evaluate the license conditions of all loaded components.  If the system
contains one or more components that are licenced under GPL-like
restrictions the system indicates this program may only be distributed
under the \const{GPL} license as well as which components prohibit the
use of other license conditions.

    \predicate{license}{2}{+LicenseId, +Component}
Register the fact that \arg{Component} is distributed under a license
identified by \arg{LicenseId}. The most important \arg{LicenseId}'s are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{swipl}{}
Indicates this module is distributed under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) with the SWI-Prolog exception:%
    \footnote{This exception is a straight re-phrasing of the license
	      used for \file{libgcc}, the GNU-C runtime library facing
	      similar technical issues.}

\begin{quote}\it
As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
compiled with SWI-Prolog, to produce an executable, this library does
not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any
other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU
General Public License.
\end{quote}

This should be the default for software contributed to the SWI-Prolog
project as it allows the community to prosper both in the free and
non-free world.  Still, people using SWI-Prolog to create non-free
applications must contribute sources to improvements they make to
the community.

	\termitem{lgpl}{}
This is the default license for foreign-libraries linked with
SWI-Prolog. Use PL_license() to register the condition from foreign
code.

	\termitem{gpl}{}
Indicates this module is strictly Free Software, which implies it cannot
be used together with any module that is incompatible to the GPL. Please
only use these conditions when forced by other code used in the
component.
    \end{description}

Other licenses known to the system are \const{guile}, \const{gnu_ada},
\const{x11}, \const{expat}, \const{sml}, \const{public_domain},
\const{cryptix}, \const{bsd}, \const{zlib}, const{lgpl_compatible}
and \const{gpl_compatible}.  New licenses can be defined by adding
clauses for the multifile predicate license:license/3.  Below is
an example.  The second argument is either \const{gpl} or \const{lgpl}
to indicate compatibility to these licenses.  Other values cause the
license to interpreted as \jargon{proprietary}.  Proprietary licenses
are reported by eval_license/0.  See the file \file{boot/license.pl} for
details.

\begin{code}
:- multifile license:license/3.

license:license(mylicense, lgpl,
		[ comment('My personal license'),
		  url('http://www.mine.org/license.html')
		]).

:- license(mylicense).
\end{code}

    \predicate{license}{1}{+LicenseId}
Intented as a directive in Prolog source files.  It takes the current
filename and calls license/2.

    \cfunction{void}{PL_license}{const char *LicenseId, const char *Component}
Intended for the install() procedure of foreign libraries. This call can
be made \emph{before} PL_initialise().
