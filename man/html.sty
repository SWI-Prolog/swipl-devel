% Comment.sty   version 2.0, 19 June 1992
% selectively in/exclude pieces of text: the user can define new
% comment versions, and each is controlled separately.
% This style can be used with plain TeX or LaTeX, and probably
% most other packages too.
%
% Examples of use in LaTeX and TeX follow \endinput

%
% Usage: all text included in between
%    \comment ... \endcomment
% or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment}
% is discarded. The closing command should appear on a line
% of its own. No starting spaces, nothing after it.
% This environment should work with arbitrary amounts
% of comment.
%
% Other 'comment' environments are defined by
% and are selected/deselected with
% \includecomment{versiona}
% \excludecoment{versionb}
%
% These environments are used as
% \versiona ... \endversiona
% or \begin{versiona} ... \end{versiona}
% with the closing command again on a line of its own.
%
% Basic approach:
% to comment something out, scoop up  every line in verbatim mode
% as macro argument, then throw it away.
% For inclusions, both the opening and closing comands
% are defined as noop
%
% Changed \next to \html@next to prevent clashes with other sty files
% (mike@emn.fr)
% Changed \html@next to \htmlnext so the \makeatletter and
% \makeatother commands could be removed (they were causing other
% style files - changebar.sty - to crash) (nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk)
% Changed \htmlnext back to \html@next...
