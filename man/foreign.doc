\chapter{Foreign Language Interface}

SWI-Prolog offers a powerful interface to C \cite{Kernighan:78}.  The
main design objectives of the foreign language interface are flexibility
and performance.  Most Prolog foreign language interfaces allow the user
only to pass primitive data through the interface.  The user should
normally specify for each argument whether it is an input or output
argument as well as the type of the argument.  Because type checking and
conversion to/from C data types is done by Prolog the actual foreign
code is usually short if something simple is wanted.  The SWI-Prolog
interface does not offer these primitives.  Instead Prolog terms in
their internal representation are passed via the interface.  This allows
the user to write `logical' predicates and pass arbitrary Prolog data
over the interface.  As a trade-off the user is responsible for type
checking and should be careful not to violate consistency rules as
Prolog provides access to its internal data structures.

\section{Overview of the Interface}

A special include file called ``SWI-Prolog.h'' should be included with
each C-source file that is to be loaded via the foreign interface.  The
installation process installs this file in the directory \tty{include}
in the SWI-Prolog home directory (?- feature(home, Home).).  This
C-header file defines various data types, macros and functions that can
be used to communicate with SWI-Prolog.  Functions and macros can be
divided into the following categories:

\begin{shortlist}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-2pt}
    \item Analysing arbitrary Prolog terms
    \item Constructing new terms or instantiating existing ones
    \item Returning control information to Prolog
    \item Registering foreign predicates with Prolog
    \item Registering variables with the garbage collector
    \item Calling Prolog from C
    \item Communicating about modules
    \item Printing standard Prolog warning/error messages
    \item Global actions on Prolog (halt, break, abort, etc.)
    \item Querying the status of Prolog
\end{shortlist}


\section{Linking Foreign Modules}

Foreign modules may be linked to Prolog in three ways. Using {\em
static} linking, the extensions, a small description file and the basic
SWI-Prolog object file are linked together to form a new executable.
Using {\em dynamic} linking of object files, the extensions are linked
into the running Prolog process.  Finally, on some operating systems
SWI-Prolog allows for loading dynamic libraries (called {\em shared
libraries} (\tty{.so} files) on Unix systems and {\em Dynamic Link
Libraries} (\tty{.dll} files) on many PC based operating systems.


\subsection{What linking is provided?}

The {\em static} linking schema can be used on all versions of
SWI-Prolog.  The feature/2 predicate may be used to find out what
other linking methods are provided for this version.

\begin{itemize}
    \tick{feature(load_foreign, true)}
If this succeeds the system provides the load_foreign/2 and
load_foreign/5 predicates that allow for loading object files
({\tt .o} files on Unix machines).
    \tick{feature(open_shared_object, true)}
\index{dlopen}\index{.so files}
If this succeeds the system provides the open_shared_object/2 and
related predicates that allow for handling Unix shared object files
based on the Unix library functions dlopen() and friends. See
section~\ref{sec:shlib}.
    \tick{feature(dll, true)}
If this succeeds the system provides an interface for loading \tty{.DLL}
files by means of open_dll/2 and friends. See section~\ref{sec:shlib}.
\end{itemize}

If either the feature {\em open_shared_object} or {\em dll} is true, the
library \tty{library(shlib.pl)} provides a common interface for loading
foreign files from Prolog.

Note that a specific version of SWI-Prolog may offer multiple of these
loading facilities.


\subsection{What kind of loading should I be using?}

All described approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Static
linking is portable and allows for debugging on all platforms. It is
relatively cumbersome and the libraries you need to pass to the linker
may vary from system to system.

Direct loading of object files is not very portable and generally works
only on operating systems using the old BSD Unix a.out format for object
and executable files.  Also, the text of the loaded executable is in the
data-segment of Prolog, disabling text-sharing and protection provided
by Unix and some modern PC based operating systems.

Loading shared objects or DLL files provides sharing and protection and
is generally the best choice. The problem is that save/[1,2] and
save_program/[1,2] donot cooperate with this mechanism.

Summarising, if you donot need save/[1,2] or save_program/[1,2], loading
based on \tty{library(shlib)} is probably the best choice. See
section~\ref{sec:shlib}. Otherwise use loading object files directly for
small things and static linking for large applications to exploit
sharing and protection.

Development in SWI-Prolog and operating systems are likely to make
\tty{shlib} the standard foreign loading schema for SWI-Prolog.

Note that the definition of the foreign predicates is the same, regardless
of the linking type used.


\subsection{Static Linking}				\label{sec:staticl}

Below is an outline of the files structure required for statically
linking SWI-Prolog with foreign extensions. \verb$.../pl$ refers to the
SWI-Prolog home directory (see feature/2). $<$arch$>$ refers to the
architecture identifier that may be obtained using feature/2.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb$.../pl/runtime/<arch>/pl.o$	& Main object-file \\
\verb$.../pl/include/SWI-Prolog.h$	& Include file \\
\verb$.../pl/include/SWI-Stream.h$	& Stream I/O include file \\
\verb$.../pl/include/SWI-Exports$	& Export declarations (AIX only) \\
\verb$.../pl/include/stub.c$		& Extension stub 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The definition of the foreign predicates is the same as for dynamic
linking.  Unlike with dynamic linking however, there is no
initialisation function.  Instead, the file \verb$.../pl/include/stub.c$
may be copied to your project and modified to define the foreign
extensions.  Below is stub.c, modified to link the lowercase example
described later in this chapter:

\begin{boxed}\begin{code}
/*  Copyright (c) 1991 Jan Wielemaker. All rights reserved.
    jan@swi.psy.uva.nl

    Purpose: Skeleton for extensions
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <SWI-Prolog.h>

extern foreign_t pl_lowercase(term, term);

PL_extension PL_extensions [] =
{
/*{ "name",	 arity,  function,	PL_FA_<flags> },*/

  { "lowercase", 2	 pl_lowercase,  0 },
  { NULL,	 0, 	 NULL,		0 }	/* terminating line */
};


int
main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)
{ if ( !PL_initialise(argc, argv, env) )
    PL_halt(1);

  PL_halt(PL_toplevel() ? 0 : 1);
}
\end{code}\end{boxed}

Now, a new executable may be created using the make(1) Makefile
fragment below.  The correct versions for the variables may be
obtained using the feature/2 predicate:

\begin{code}
?- feature(c_cc,         CC).
?- feature(c_ldflags,    LDFLAGS).
?- feature(c_staticlibs, STATICLIBS).
?- feature(c_libs,	 LIBS).
?- feature(arch,	 ARCH).
?- feature(home,	 HOME).
\end{code}

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
CC=gcc
HOME=/usr/local/lib/pl-2.0.6
CFLAGS=-I$(HOME)/include
LDFLAGS=
STATICLIBS=/usr/lib/libc.a
LIBS=-lreadline -ltermcap -lm
ARCH=i486-linux

PLOBJ=$(HOME)/$(ARCH)/pl.o
OBJ=lowercase.o stub.o

lwpl:	$(PLOBJ) $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(PLOBJ) $(OBJ) $(STATICLIBS) $(LIBS)
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

The resulting \tty{lwpl} file will load the standard prolog bootstrap
file. Normally, your extensions will partly be written in Prolog. In this
case you may wish to create a new bootfile that includes the standard
Prolog system and your extensions.  Write a toplevel loadfile that loads
your application and add the following to your Makefile:

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
PLFILES:	load.pl foo.pl bar.pl

lwpl.qlf:	lwpl $(PLFILES)
		./lwpl -g mytoplevel \
		       -b $(HOME)/boot/init.pl \
		       -c load.pl
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

See also section~\ref{compilation} for compiling Prolog sources using
the \tty{-c} option.


\subsection{Dynamic Linking based on load_foreign/[2,5]}

\subsubsection{Portability Note}

The incremental linker is highly system dependent.  It can easily be
ported to machines for which the C linker allows you to link an object
file using the symbol table of a (running) executable and use BSD Unix
format a.out files.  On many Unix systems such an object file can be
created using the \tty{-A} option of ld(1).  Some operating systems
offer primitives for dynamic loading (AIX, MACH).  The following call
may be used to find out whether load_foreign is functional:
\begin{code}
?- feature(load_foreign, OK).
\end{code}

.BD
.C load_foreign 2 +File, +Entry
Load a foreign file or list of files specified by {\em File}.  The files
are searched for similar to consult/1.  Except that the `\tty{.o}'
extension is used rather than `\tty{.pl}'.  Thus `\tty{test}' is a valid
specification for `\tty{test.o}' in the current directory, `\tty{[test,
library(basics)]}' specifies `\tty{test.o}' in the current directory and
`\tty{basics.o}' in one of the library directories.

{\em Entry} defines the entry point of the resulting executable.  The
entry point will be called by Prolog to install the foreign predicates.
.C load_foreign 2 +File, +Entry, +Options, +Libraries, +Size
The first two arguments are identical to those of load_foreign/2. {\em
Options} is (a list of) additional option to be given to the loader.
The default command is:%
    \footnote{details depend on your operating system.}

\begin{code}
$(CC) -N -A <symbolfile> -T <offset> -e <entry> -o <executable>
   <files> -lc
\end{code}

The options are inserted just before the files. {\em Libraries} is (a
list of) libraries to be passed to the loader. They are inserted just
after the files.

If {\em Size} is specified Prolog first assumes that the resulting
executable will fit in {\em Size} bytes and do the loading in one pass.
If the executable turns out to be larger than {\em Size} bytes the
loading sequence is started again, using the calculated size.  To
determine the size of an executable specify a size that is too small.
Prolog will then print the actual size on the current output stream.
.C foreign_file 1 ?File
Is true if {\em File} is the absolute path name of a file loaded as
foreign file.
.ED

\section{Dynamic Linking of shared libraries}

The interface defined in this section allows the user to load shared
libraries (.so files on most Unix systems).  This interface is portable
to all machines providing the function dlopen() or an equivalent,
normally from the library -ldl.  These functions provide the basic
interface layer.  It is adviced to use the predicates from
section~\ref{sec:shlib} in your application.


.BD
.C open_shared_object 2 +File, -Handle
{\em File} is the name of a .so file (see your C programmers
documentation on how to create a .so file).  This file is attached to
the current process and {\em Handle} is unified with a handle to the
shared object.
.C close_shared_object 1 +Handle
Detach the shared object identified by {\em Handle}.
.C call_shared_object_function 2 +Handle, +Function
Call the named function in the loaded shared library.  The function
is called without arguments and the return-value is ignored.  Normally
this function installs foreign language predicates using calls to
PL_register_foreign().
.ED


\section{Using the library shlib for .DLL and .so files} \label{sec:DLL}
						         \label{sec:shlib}

This section discusses the functionality of the (autoload) library {\tt
shlib.pl}, providing an interface to shared libraries. Currently it 
supports MS-Windows DLL (\tty{.dll}) libraries and Unix \tty{.so}
(shared object) files.

.BD
.C load_foreign_library 1 +Lib
Equivalent to load_foreign_library(Lib, install).
.C load_foreign_library 2 +Lib, +Entry
Search for the given foreign library and link it to the current
SWI-Prolog instance.  The library may be specified with or without the
extension.  It is searched for using the operating-system defined
searching mechanism.  If the library can be loaded, the function
called {\em Entry} will be called without arguments.  The return value
of the function is ignored.

The {\em Entry} function will normally call PL_register_foreign() to
declare functions in the library as foreign predicates.
.C unload_foreign_library 1 +Lib
If the foreign library defines the function \tty{uninstall}, this
function will be called without arguments and its return value is
ignored.  Next, abolish/2 is used to remove all known foreign predicates
defined in the library. Finally the library itself is detatched from the
process.
.C current_foreign_library 2 -Lib, -Predicates
Query the currently loaded foreign libraries and their predicates.  {\em
Predicates} is a list with elements of the form {\em Module:Head},
indicating the predicates installed with PL_register_foreign().
.ED

Figure~\ref{fig:msgbox} connects a Windows message-box using a foreign
function.  This example was tested using Windows-NT and Microsoft Visual
C++ 2.0.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
#include <windows.h>
#include <SWI-Prolog.h>

static foreign_t
pl_say_hello(term_t to)
{ if ( PL_is_atom(to) )
  { char *a = PL_atom_value(PL_atomic(to));

    MessageBox(NULL, a, "DLL test", MB_OK|MB_TASKMODAL);

    PL_succeed;
  }

  PL_fail;
}

install_t
install()
{ PL_register_foreign("say_hello", 1, pl_say_hello, 0);
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}
    \caption{MessageBox() example in Windows-NT}
    \label{fig:msgbox}
\end{figure}


\section{Interface Data types}

The interface functions can be divided into two groups. The first group
are functions to obtain data from Prolog or pass data to Prolog. These
functions use Prolog internal data types. The second group consists of
type conversion functions convert between Prolog internal data and C
primitive types. Below is a description of the types used in the
interface.

\begin{description}
    \item[term_t]
Terms represent arbitrary Prolog data (variables, atoms, integers,
floats and compound terms).  Terms live either until backtracking takes
us back to a point before the term was created or the garbage collector
has collected the term.
    \item[atomic_t]
Atomics are Prologs primitive data types (integers, atoms and floats).
They can be transformed to C data types (int, char * resp.\ double).
The Prolog representation for an integer is a tagged version of that
integer. The mapping between C ints and Prolog integers can only be
different over different releases of SWI-Prolog. Atoms are represented
by a pointer to a data structure on the Prolog heap. Each such data
structure is a unique representation of a string (e.g. to verify that
two atoms represent the same string comparing the atoms suffices). The
mapping between atoms and string are likely to vary over different
sessions of Prolog. Floats are represented as (tagged) pointers to a
float living on the global stack. For their life time the same rules
apply as for terms. Whether two floats represent the same number can
only be discovered by transforming both to C floats and then comparing
them. Strings are represented as a tagged pointer to a char * on the
global stack or heap. The rules for their lifetime and comparison equal
those for floats and terms.
    \item[functor_t]
A functor is the internal representation of a name/arity pair. They are
used to find the name and arity of a compound term as well as to
construct new compound terms. Like atoms they live for the whole Prolog
session and are unique.
    \item[predicate_t]
Handle to a foreign predicate using with PL_call_predicate(). Predicates
live forever (although they can loose their definition).
    \item[module_t]
A module is a unique handle to a Prolog module. Modules are used only
to call predicates in a specific module.
    \item[foreign_t]
Return type for a C-function implementing a Prolog predicate.
    \item[install_t]
Type for the \tty{install()} and \tty{uninstall()} functions of shared
or dynamic link libraries.  See section~\ref{sec:shlib}.
\end{description}

\section{The Foreign Include File}

\subsection{Argument Passing and Control}

If Prolog encounters a foreign predicate at run time it will call a
function specified in the predicate definition of the foreign predicate.
The arguments (1, ..., arity) pass the Prolog arguments to the goal as
Prolog terms.  Foreign functions should be declared of type {\tt
foreign_t}.  Deterministic foreign functions have two alternatives to
return control back to Prolog:

.BF
.M void PL_succeed 0
Succeed deterministically. PL_succeed is defined as ``return TRUE''.
.M void PL_fail 0
Fail and start Prolog backtracking.  PL_fail is defined as ``return
FALSE''.
.EF

\subsubsection{Non-deterministic Foreign Predicates}

By default foreign predicates are deterministic.  Using the {\tt
PL_FA_NONDETERMINISTIC} attribute (see PL_register_foreign()) it is
possible to register a predicate as a non-deterministic predicate.
Writing non-deterministic foreign predicates is slightly more
complicated as the foreign function needs context information for
generating the next solution.  Note that the same foreign function
should be prepared to be simultaneously active in more than one goal.
Suppose the natural_number_below_n/2 is a non-deterministic foreign
predicate, backtracking over all natural numbers lower than the first
argument.  Now consider the following predicate:

\begin{boxed}\begin{code}
quotient_below_n(Q, N) :-
	natural_number_below_n(N, N1),
	natural_number_below_n(N, N2),
	Q =:= N1 / N2, !.
\end{code}\end{boxed}

In this predicate the function natural_number_below_n/2 simultaneously
generates solutions for both its invocations.

Non-deterministic foreign functions should be prepared to handle three
different calls from Prolog:

\begin{description}
    \item[Initial call (\tt PL_FIRST_CALL)]\mbox{}\\
Prolog has just created a frame for the foreign function and asks it to
produce the first answer.
    \item[Redo call (\tt PL_REDO)]\mbox{}\\
The previous invocation of the foreign function associated with the
current goal indicated it was possible to backtrack.  The foreign
function should produce the next solution.
    \item[Terminate call (\tt PL_CUTTED)]\mbox{}\\
The choice point left by the foreign function has been destroyed by
a cut.  The foreign function is given the opportunity to clean the
environment.
\end{description}

Both the context information and the type of call is provided by an
argument of type {\tt foreign_t} appended to the argument list for
deterministic foreign functions.  The macro PL_foreign_control()
extracts the type of call from the control argument.  The foreign
function can pass a context handle using the PL_retry() macro and
extract the handle from the extra argument using the
PL_foreign_context() macro.

.BF
.M void PL_retry 1 handle
The foreign function succeeds while leaving a choice point. On
backtracking over this goal the foreign function will be called again,
but the control argument now indicates it is a `Redo' call and the
macro PL_foreign_context() will return the handle passed via
PL_retry(). This handle is a 30 bits signed value (two bits are used
for status indication).
.M int PL_foreign_control 1 control_argument
Extracts the type of call from the control argument.  The return values
are described above.  Note that the function should be prepared to
handle the {\tt PL_CUTTED} case and should be aware that the other
arguments are not valid in this case.
.M long PL_foreign_context 1 control_argument
Extracts the context from the context argument.  In the call type is
{\tt PL_FIRST_CALL} the context value is 0L.  Otherwise it is the value
returned by the last PL_retry() associated with this goal (both if the
call type is {\tt PL_REDO} as {\tt PL_CUTTED}).
.EF

Note: If a non-deterministic foreign function returns using PL_succeed
or PL_fail,  Prolog assumes the foreign function has cleaned its
environment. {\bf No} call with control argument {\tt PL_CUTTED} will follow.

The code of figure~\ref{fig:nondetermf} shows a skeleton for a
non-deterministic foreign predicate definition.

\begin{figure}
\begin{boxed}\begin{code}
typedef struct			/* define a context structure */
{ ...
} context;

foreign_t
my_function(term_t a0, term_t a1, foreign_t handle)
{ struct context * ctxt;

  switch( PL_foreign_control(handle) )
  { case PL_FIRST_CALL:
        ctxt = (struct context *) malloc(sizeof(struct context));
	...
	PL_retry(ctxt);
    case PL_REDO:
	ctxt = (struct context *) PL_foreign_context(handle);
	...
	PL_retry(ctxt);
    case PL_CUTTED:
	free(ctxt);
	PL_succeed;
  }
}
\end{code}\end{boxed}
    \caption{Skeleton for non-deterministic foreign functions}
    \label{fig:nondetermf}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysing Terms via the Foreign Interface}

Each argument of a foreign function (except for the control argument)
is of type {\em term_t}.  To analyse a term one should first obtain the
type of the term. Primitive terms can then be transformed into {\em
atomic} data in internal Prolog representation. This atomic data can be
transformed into C-data types. Complex terms are analysed in terms on
their functor and arguments. The arguments themselves are terms,
allowing the same procedure to be repeated recursively.

.BF
.F int PL_type 1 term_t
Obtain the type of {\em term}, which should be a term returned by one
of the other interface predicates or passed as an argument. The
function returns the type of the Prolog term. The type identifiers are
listed below.

\begin{tabular}{p{\tableft}p{3.5in}}
\tt PL_VARIABLE & An unbound variable. The value of term as such is a unique
	          identifier for the variable. \\
\tt PL_ATOM	& A Prolog atom. \\
\tt PL_STRING	& A Prolog string. \\
\tt PL_INTEGER  & A Prolog integer. \\
\tt PL_FLOAT    & A Prolog floating point number. \\
\tt PL_TERM	& A compound term. Note that a list is a compound term with
	          name `.' and arity 2. \\
\end{tabular}
.EF

The functions PL_is_$<$type$>$ allow form an alternative to
PL_type.  The test ``PL_is_var(term)'' is equivalent to ``PL_type(term) ==
PL_VARIABLE'', but the first is considerably faster.

.BF
.F int PL_is_var 1 term_t
Returns non-zero if {\em term} is a variable.
.F int PL_is_atom 1 term_t
Returns non-zero if {\em term} is an atom.
.F int PL_is_string 1 term_t
Returns non-zero if {\em term} is a string.
.F int PL_is_int 1 term_t
Returns non-zero if {\em term} is an integer.
.F int PL_is_float 1 term_t
Returns non-zero if {\em term} is a float.
.F int PL_is_term 1 term_t
Returns non-zero if {\em term} is a compound term.
.F atomic_t PL_atomic 1 term_t
Return the atomic value of {\em term} in Prolog internal
representation. {\em Term} should be atomic (e.g. atom, integer,
float or string).
.F long PL_integer_value 1 atomic_t
Transforms an integer from Prolog internal representation into a C
long.
.F double PL_float_value 1 atomic_t
Transforms a float from Prolog internal representation into a C
double.
.F char * PL_atom_value 1 atomic_t
Transforms an atom from Prolog internal representation into a 0-terminated
C char *. The pointer points directly into the Prolog heap and can
assumed to be static. The contents of the character string however
should under NO circumstances be modified.
.F char * PL_string_value 1 string
Transform a string from Prolog internal representation into a C char *.
The pointer points directly into the Prolog data area. Unlike the
pointer returned by PL_atom_value() the C user should copy the value to
a private data area if its value should survive the current foreign
language call.  Like PL_atom_value(), changing the contents of the
character string is NOT allowed.
.F functor_t PL_functor 1 term_t
{\em term} should be a complex term. The return value is a unique
identifier of the term's name and arity. The following example
demonstrates this:

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
pl_same_functor(term_t t1, term_t t2)
{ if ( !PL_is_term(t1) || !PL_is_term(t2) )
    PL_fail;
  if ( PL_functor(t1) == PL_functor(t2) )
    PL_succeed;
  PL_fail;
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}
.F atomic_t PL_functor_name 1 functor_t
Return an atom representing the name of {\em functor}. To get the
functor name as char * of a term which is known to be compound:

\mbox{\tt \#define functor_name(term) PL_atom_value(PL_functor_name(PL_functor(term)))}

.F int PL_functor_arity 1 functor_t
Return a C integer representing the arity of {\em functor}.
.F term PL_arg 2 term_t, int
Return the {\em int}-th argument of {\em term}.  Argument counting
starts at 1 and is valid up to and including the arity of {\em term}.  No
checks on these boundaries are performed.
.EF

Figure~\ref{fig:pl-display} shows a definition of display/1 to
illustrate the described functions.

\begin{figure}
\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
pl_display(term_t t)
{ functor_t functor;
  int arity, n;

  switch( PL_type(t) )
  { case PL_VARIABLE:
	printf("_%d", t);
	break;
    case PL_ATOM:
	printf("%s", PL_atom_value(PL_atomic(t)));
	break;
    case PL_STRING:
	printf("\"%s\"", PL_string_value(PL_atomic(t)));
	break;
    case PL_INTEGER:
	printf("%d", PL_integer_value(PL_atomic(t)));
	break;
    case PL_FLOAT:
	printf("%f", PL_float_value(PL_atomic(t)));
	break;
    case PL_TERM:
	functor = PL_functor(t);
	arity = PL_functor_arity(functor);
	printf("%s", PL_atom_value(PL_functor_name(functor)));
	printf("(");
	pl_display(PL_arg(t, 1));
	for( n = 2; n <= arity; n++)
	{ printf(", ");
	  pl_display(PL_arg(t, n));
	}
	printf(")");
	break;
    default:
	PL_fatal_error("Illegal type in pl_display(): %d",
						PL_type(t));
  }

  PL_succeed;
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Instantiating and Constructing Terms}

Terms are instantiated as in Prolog itself by unification.  Variables
can be unified with atomic data, with a functor and with other terms.
New terms are first constructed as a single unbound variable.

.BF
.F term_t PL_new_term 0
Create a new term. The term is an unbound variable living on the global
stack. In the current implementation it lives until Prolog backtracks
to before this call. Garbage collection might change this in the
future.
.F atomic_t PL_new_atom 1 char *
Create a Prolog atom from a C char *. The contents of the char * are
copied to the Prolog heap.
.F atomic_t PL_new_string 1 char *
Create a Prolog string, living on the global stack. The contents of the
char * are copied into Prolog's data area.
.F atomic_t PL_new_integer 1 long
Create a Prolog integer from a C long. Note that the integer is
truncated to 28 bits. No checks on this are performed.
.F atomic_t PL_new_float 1 double
Create a Prolog float living on the global stack from {\em double}.
.F functor_t PL_new_functor 2 atomic_t, int
Create a Prolog functor identifier form {\em atomic} (which should be
an atom) and {int}, the arity. {\em Arity} is valid for
any $arity \ge 0$. $Arity = 0$ is used internally, but none of the
interface functions use it.
.F int PL_unify 2 term_t, term_t
Unify two terms. Return value is \tty{TRUE} or \tty{FALSE}.
.F int PL_unify_atomic 2 term_t, atomic_t
Unify a term with an atomic value.
.F int PL_unify_functor 2 term_t, functor_t
Unify a term with a functor. The unification simply succeeds if {\em
term} is already instantiated to a term with functor {\em functor}. If
{\em term} is  variable it will be instantiated to the
most general term of {\em functor} (e.g. a term with all arguments
unbound variables). Otherwise \tty{FALSE} is returned.

If this call succeeds the arguments can be further instantiated by
calling PL_arg() and recursively unifying the returned terms.
.EF

An example of using these functions is shown in figure~\ref{fig:calling}.

\subsection{Interaction with the garbage collector and stack-shifter}

C-functions that manipulate Prolog terms manipulate pointers to the
Prolog runtime stacks.  Prolog implements two mechanisms for avoiding
stack overflow: garbage collection and stack expansion.  On machines
that allow for it, Prolog will use virtual memory management to detect
stack overflow and expand the runtime stacks.  On other machines Prolog
will reallocate the stacks and update all pointers to them.  To do
so, Prolog needs to know which variables of active C-functions contain
references to Prolog data.

C-variables may be registered with the Prolog engine using the macro
PL_lock() and unregistered using PL_unlock().  These macros should
be perfectly balanced and any term locked in a C-function needs to be
unlocked before control is passed back to Prolog.

A C-variable that is registered must hold valid Prolog data or `0'.

.BF
.F void PL_lock 1 term_t
Register the named C-variable with the Prolog engine.  The variable
should hold a valid Prolog term.  The value of the variable may be
changed while it remains locked.  Each locked variable must be unlocked
using PL_unlock().  Locking and unlocking must be balanced.
.F void PL_unlock 1 term_t
Unlock a locked variable.  If the named variable is not the most recently
locked variable an error message is printed.  If a foreign function leaves
variables unlocked an error message is issued as well.
.EF

\subsubsection{When is locking necessary}

Stacks shifts or garbage collections may be forced if there is
insufficient space on the stacks.  Data is pushed on the stacks
by most of the term construction functions and if the Prolog engine
is called using PL_call() or PL_call_predicate().  

By default the Prolog engine ensures the stacks have a minimum of
`min_free' (see stack_parameter/4) space when a foreign predicate is
activated.  If this is insufficient, Prolog checks whether a garbage
collection may be performed or the stacks may be enlarged.%
   \footnote{When using virtual memory based stacks the system can
             always enlarge the stacks as it needs not to shift them.}
By default Prolog assumes it is {\em not} save to shift the stacks
or perform a garbage collection when foreign code is active.

Simple C-defined predicates that do not call Prolog and do not use the
term-construction functions intensively do not need to use PL_lock() and
PL_unlock().  C-defined predicates that perform call-back on Prolog
or use the term construction primitives to (potentially) create large 
data structures should protect their variables and should defined the
PL_FA_GCSAVE attribute (see PL_register_foreign()).


\subsection{Calling Prolog from C}

The Prolog system can be called back from C. This is done by
constructing a term with the functions described above and then calling
PL_call(). PL_call() executes the goal and returns TRUE or FALSE
depending on success or failure of the called predicate. There are no
means to backtrack over the Prolog predicate. If alternatives are
wanted call findall/3 and read the result from the third argument.

.BF
.F int PL_call 2 term_t, module_t
Call term just like the Prolog predicate once/1. {\em Term} is called
in the specified module, or in the context module if module_t = NULL.
Returns \tty{TRUE} if the call succeeds, \tty{FALSE} otherwise.
Figure~\ref{fig:calling} shows an example to obtain the number of
defined atoms. All checks are omitted to improve readability.
.EF

\subsection{Discarding Data}

The Prolog data created during setting up the call and calling Prolog can in
most cases be discarded right after the call.  See figure~\ref{fig:calling}
for an example.

.BF
.F void PL_mark 1 bktrk_buf
Mark the global and trail stacks in {\em bktrk_buf}.
.F void PL_bktrk 1 bktrk_buf
Undo all changes in the runtime stacks since a snapshot has been made
in buffer using PL_mark(). Changes to the heap are not affected.
.EF

It is not necessary to call PL_bktrk() for each PL_mark(). The user
should ensure that PL_bktrk() is never called with a buffer that is
created after a buffer to which PL_bktrk() has been called. Thus
PL_mark(b1) ... PL_mark(b2) ... PL_bktrk(b1) is valid, but it is not
allowed to call PL_bktrk(b2) after this sequence.

\begin{figure}
\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
int
count_atoms()
{ term t;
  int atoms;
  bktrk_buf buf;
  
  PL_mark(&buf);	    /* mark the global stack */

  t = PL_new_term();        /* create `statistics(atoms, Var)' */
  PL_unify_functor(t, PL_new_functor(PL_new_atom("statistics"), 2));
  PL_unify_atomic(PL_arg(t,1), PL_new_atom("atoms"));
  
  PL_call(t, NULL);         /* call it in current module */
  
			    /* extract the value from the 2nd arg */
  atoms = PL_integer_value(PL_atomic(PL_arg(t, 2)));
  
  PL_bktrk(&buf);    	    /* discard global stack data created */
  
  return atoms;
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}
     \caption{Calling Prolog}
     \label{fig:calling}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Calls based on predicate references}

In some situations, callback is highly time-critical and needs to be
performed often on the same predicate.  In these cases, Pl_call() may
be too slow as it involves building the gaol using various unification
calls and calling PL_call() that will again unpack the call-term.  In
these cases the interface described in this section may be useful.

.BF
.F predicate_t PL_predicate 2 functor_t, module_t
Return a handle to the given predicate in the given module.  If module_t
is \tty{NULL}, the current context module will be used.  This call
always succeeds, possibly creating a handle to an undefined predicate.
.F int PL_call_predicate 4 module_t, int debug, predicate_t, term_t *argv
Use a predicate handle to call {\em predicate} with the given arguments.
The vector {\em argv} must point to a vector of Prolog terms with
enough elements for the predicate.

The {\em module} argument defines the context module of the goal if the
called predicate is module transparent. If this argument is specified is
\tty{NULL}, this is the current context module. If no context is
available it is the \tty{user} module. If the {\em debug} argument is
\tty{FALSE}, the call will be hidden from the Prolog debugger.

The {\em module} and {\em debug} arguments are in almost all normal
cases \tty{NULL} and \tty{TRUE}.  They are needed for some internal
cases.  PL_call_predicate() is the function containing the actual
Prolog Virtual Machine Interpreter, flattening the call-stack as far
as possible%
    \footnote{Especially on the SUN SPARC cpu this is critical for
	      good Prolog/C/Prolog calling performance}
.EF

The following example realises the same as the example from
figure~\ref{fig:calling}

\begin{figure}
\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
int
count_atoms()
{ term_t t[2];
  int atoms;
  bktrk_buf buf;
  
  PL_mark(&buf);	    /* mark the global stack */

  t[0] = PL_new_term();        /* create `statistics(atoms, Var)' */
  t[1] = PL_new_term();
  PL_unify_atomic(t[0], PL_new_atom("atoms"));
  PL_call_predicate(NULL, TRUE,
		    PL_predicate(PL_functor(PL_new_atom("statistics"), 2)
				 PL_new_module(PL_new_atom("user"))),
		    t);

			    /* extract the value from the 2nd arg */
  atoms = PL_integer_value(PL_atomic(t[1]));
  
  PL_bktrk(&buf);    	    /* discard global stack data created */
  
  return atoms;
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}
     \caption{Using PL_call_predicate}
     \label{fig:callpred}
\end{figure}

Finally, the direct predicate interface provides some utility functions.

.BF
.F int PL_predicate_arity 1 predicate_t
Returns the number of arguments required by the predicate.  The argument
vector provided to PL_call_predicate() should contain at least this
number of elements.
.F atomic_t PL_predicate_name 1 predicate_t
Returns an atom identifying the name of the predicate.
.F functor_t PL_predicate_functor 1 predicate_t
Functor description of the term.  This is always the same as the first
argument of the PL_predicate() call used to find the predicate.
.F module_t PL_predicate_module 1 predicate_t
Returns a handle to the module in which the predicate is defined.  Note
that this is not necessarily the same as the module handle used to
locate the predicate with PL_predicate() as the predicate may be
imported.  As predicate modifications may change the import/export
relations, the return value may change between calls.
.EF



\subsection{Foreign Code and Modules}

Modules are identified via a unique handle.  The following functions
are available to query and manipulate modules.

.BF
.F module_t PL_context 0
Return the module identifier of the context module of the currently
active foreign predicate.
.F term_t PL_strip_module 2 term_t, module_t *
Utility function. If {\em term_t} is a term, possibly holding the module
construct {\em module:rest} this function will return {\em rest} and
fill {\em module *} with {\em module}. For further nested module
constructs the inner most module is returned via {\em module *}. If
{\em term} is not a module construct {\em term} will simply be returned.
If {\em module *} is \tty{NULL} it will be set to the context module.
Otherwise it will be left untouched. The following example shows how to
obtain the plain term and module if the default module is the user
module:

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
{ module m = PL_new_module(PL_new_atom("user"));

  if ( (term = PL_strip_module(term, &m)) == NULL )
    return PL_warning("Illegal module specification");

  ...
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

.F atomic_t PL_module_name 1 module_t
Return the name of {\em module} as an atom.
.F module_t PL_new_module 1 atomic_t
Find an existing or create a new module with name specified by the atom
{\em atomic}.
.EF

\subsection{Catching Signals (Software Interrupts)}

SWI-Prolog catches the Unix signals SIGINT, SIGFPE and SIGSEGV.  To
avoid problems with foreign code attempting to catch these signals
foreign code should call PL_signal() to install signal handlers rather
than the Unix library function signal().  SWI-Prolog will always handle
SIGINT itself.  SIGFPE and SIGSEGV are passed to the foreign code
handlers if Prolog did not expect that signal.

.BF
.F void (*PL_signal({\it{sig,~func}})) 0
This function should be used to install signal handlers rather than the
Unix library function signal().  It ensures consistent signal handling
between SWI-Prolog and the foreign code and reinstalls signal handlers
if a state created with save_program/1 is restarted.
.EF


\subsection{Errors and warnings}

Two standard functions are available to print standard Prolog errors to
the standard error stream.

.BF
.F int PL_warning 1 format, a1, ...
Print an error message starting with `\tty{[WARNING: }', followed by
the output from {\em format}, followed by a `\tty{]}' and a newline.
Then start the tracer. {\em format} and the arguments are the same as
for printf(2).  Always returns FALSE.
.F void PL_fatal_error 1 format, a1, ...
Print a message like PL_warning(), but starting with `\tty{FATAL ERROR: }'
and then exits Prolog.
.EF

\subsection{Environment Control from Foreign Code}
.BF
.F int PL_action 2 int, C_type
Perform some action on the Prolog system. {\em int} describes the
action, {\em C_type} provides the argument if necessary. The actions
are listed in table~\ref{tab:action}.

\begin{table}
\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{|p{\tableft}|p{3.5in}|}
\hline
\tt PL_ACTION_TRACE	& Start Prolog tracer \\
\tt PL_ACTION_DEBUG	& Switch on Prolog debug mode \\
\tt PL_ACTION_BACKTRACE	& Print backtrace on current output stream.
			  The argument (an int) is the number of frames
			  printed. \\
\tt PL_ACTION_HALT	& Halt Prolog execution. This action should be
			  called rather than Unix exit() to give Prolog
			  the opportunity to clean up. This call does
			  not return. \\
\tt PL_ACTION_ABORT	& Generate a Prolog abort. This call does not
			  return. \\
\tt PL_ACTION_BREAK	& Create a standard Prolog break environment. Returns
			  after the user types control-D. \\
\tt PL_ACTION_SYMBOLFILE& The argument (a char *) is considered to be
			  hold the symbolfile for further incremental
			  loading. Should be called by user applications
			  that perform incremental loading as well and
			  want to inform Prolog of the new symbol table. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

    \caption{PL_action() options}
    \label{tab:action}
\end{table}
.EF

\subsection{Querying Prolog}
.BF
.F C_type PL_query 1 int
Obtain status information on the Prolog system. The actual argument
type depends on the information required. {\em int} describes what
information is wanted. The  options are given in table~\ref{tab:query}.


\begin{table}
\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{|p{\tableft}|p{3.5in}|}
\hline
\tt PL_QUERY_ARGC	& Return an integer holding the number of
			  arguments given to Prolog from Unix. \\
\tt PL_QUERY_ARGV	& Return a char ** holding the argument vector
			  given to Prolog from Unix. \\
\tt PL_QUERY_SYMBOLFILE & Return a char * holding the current symbol
			  file of the running process. \\
\tt PL_QUERY_ORGSYMBOLFILE& Return the initial symbol file (before
			  loading) of Prolog. By setting the symbol file
			  to this value no name clashes can occur with
			  previously loaded foreign files (but no symbols
			  can be shared with earlier loaded modules as well). \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

    \caption{PL_query() options}
    \label{tab:query}
\end{table}
.EF

\subsection{Registering Foreign Predicates}
.BF
.F int PL_register_foreign 4 name, arity, function, flags
Register a C-function to implement a Prolog predicate. After this call
returns successfully a predicate with name {\em name} (a char *) and
arity {\em arity} (a C int) is created. When called in Prolog, Prolog
will call {\em function}. {\em flags} forms bitwise or'ed list of
options for the installation. These are:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{|p{\tableft}|p{3.5in}|}
\hline
\tt PL_FA_NOTRACE	& Predicate cannot be seen in the tracer \\
\tt PL_FA_TRANSPARENT	& Predicate is module transparent \\
\tt PL_FA_NONDETERMINISTIC & Predicate is non-deterministic. This
			  attribute is currently ignored, but will probably
			  be used in future versions. \\
\tt PL_FA_GCSAVE	& The C-implementation properly uses PL_lock()
			  and PL_unlock() to protect variables from the
			  garbage collector and stack-shifter \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
.EF

\subsection{Foreign Code Hooks}

For various specific applications some hooks re provided.

.BF
.F PL_dispatch_hook_t PL_dispatch_hook 1 PL_dispatch_hook_t
If this hook is not NULL, this function is called when reading from the
terminal. It is supposed to dispatch events when SWI-Prolog is connected
to a window environment. It can return two values: {\tt
PL_DISPATCH_INPUT} indicates Prolog input is available on file
descriptor 0 or \tty{PL_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT} to indicate a timeout. The old
hook is returned. The type \tty{PL_dispatch_hook_t} is defined as:
\begin{code}
typedef int  (*PL_dispatch_hook_t)(void);
\end{code}
.F void PL_abort_hook 1 PL_abort_hook_t
Install a hook when abort/0 is executed. SWI-Prolog abort/0 is
implemented using C setjmp()/longjmp() construct.  The hooks are
executed in the reverse order of their registration after the longjmp()
took place and before the Prolog toplevel is reinvoked. The type
\tty{PL_abort_hook_t} is defined as:
\begin{code}
typedef void (*PL_abort_hook_t)(void);
\end{code}
.F int PL_abort_unhook 1 PL_abort_hook_t
Remove a hook installed with PL_abort_hook(). Returns \tty{FALSE} if no
such hook is found, \tty{TRUE} otherwise.
.F void PL_reinit_hook 1 PL_reinit_hook_t
Install a hook that is called when a saved program (using
save_program/[1,2]) is restored. The hooks are called in reverse order.
The type \tty{PL_reinit_hook_t} is defined as:
\begin{code}
typedef void (*PL_reinit_hook_t)(int argc, char **argv);
\end{code}
.F int PL_reinit_unhook 1 PL_reinit_hook_t
Remove a hook installed with PL_reinit_hook(). Returns \tty{FALSE} if
no such hook is found, \tty{TRUE} otherwise.
.EF


\subsection{Embedding SWI-Prolog in a C-program}

As of version 2.1.0, SWI-Prolog may be embedded in a C-program.
To reach at a compiled C-program with SWI-Prolog as an embedded
application is very similar to creating a statically linked SWI-Prolog
executable as described in section~\ref{sec:staticl}.

The file {\tt pl-stub.c} defines SWI-Prologs default main program:

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
int
main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)
{ if ( !PL_initialise(argc, argv, env) )
    PL_halt(1);

  PL_halt(PL_toplevel() ? 0 : 1);
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

This may be replaced with your own main C-program. The interface
function PL_initialise() {\bf must} be called before any of the other
SWI-Prolog foreign language functions described in this chapter.  
PL_initialise() interprets all the command-line arguments, except for
the {\tt -t toplevel} flag that is interpreted by PL_toplevel().

.BF
.F int PL_initialise 3 int argc, char **argv, char **environ
Initialises the SWI-Prolog heap and stacks, restores the boot QLF file,
loads the system and personal initialisation initialisation files, runs
the at_initialisation/1 hooks and finally runs the {\tt -g goal} hook.

PL_initialise() returns 1 if all initialisation succeeded and 0
otherwise.  Various fatal errors may cause PL_initialise to call
PL_halt(1), preventing it from returning at all.
.F int PL_toplevel 0
Runs the goal of the {\tt -t toplevel} switch (default prolog/0) and
returns 1 if successfull, 0 otherwise.
.F void PL_halt 1 int status
Cleanup the Prolog environment and calls exit() with the status
argument.

\section{Example of Using the Foreign Interface}

Below is an example showing all stages of the declaration of a foreign
predicate that transforms atoms possibly holding uppercase letters
into an atom only holding lower case letters.
Figure~\ref{fig:lowercase-c} shows the C-source file.

  atomic_t la;

  if ( !PL_is_atom(u) )
    return PL_warning("lowercase/2: instantiation fault");
  s = PL_atom_value(PL_atomic(u));
  copy = (char *) malloc(strlen(s)+1);

  for( q=copy; *s; q++, s++)
    *q = (isupper(*s) ? tolower(*s) : *s);
  *q = '\0';

  la = PL_new_atom(copy);
  free(copy);

  return PL_unify_atomic(l, la);
}

init_lowercase()
{ PL_register_foreign("lowercase", 2, pl_lowercase, 0);
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

\subsection{Compiling and Loading Foreign Code}

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
sun% cc -I/usr/local/lib/pl/include -O -c lowercase.c
sun% pl
.VERSION

1 ?- load_foreign(lowercase, init_lowercase).
foreign file(s) lowercase loaded, 0.016667 seconds, 464 bytes. 

Yes
2 ?- lowercase('Hello World!', L).

L = 'hello world!' 

Yes
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

\section{Notes on Using Foreign Code}

\subsection{Garbage Collection and Foreign Code}

Currently no interface between foreign code and the garbage collector
has been defined.  The garbage collector is disabled during execution of
foreign code.  Future versions might define such an interface.  This
probably will introduce incompatible changes to the current interface
definition.

\subsection{Memory Allocation}

SWI-Prolog's memory allocation is based on the malloc() library
routines.  Foreign applications can savely use malloc(), realloc() and
free(). Memory allocation using brk() or sbrk() is not allowed as these
calls conflict with malloc().

\subsection{Debugging Foreign Code}

NOTE: this section is highly machine dependent. The tricks described
here are tested on SUN-3 and SUN-4. They might work on other
BSD variants of Unix.

Debugging incrementally loaded executables is a bit more difficult than
debugging normal executables. The oldest way of debugging (putting
print statements in your code at critical points) of course still
works. `Post-crash' debugging however is not possible. For adb/dbx to
work they need (besides the core) the text segment and the symbol
table. The symbol table lives somewhere on /tmp (called
`\tty{/tmp/pl_ld_..._.}', where `...' is the process id and `.' is an
additional number to make sure the temporary file is unique. The text
segment lives partly in the core (the incremental loaded bit) and
partly in the SWI-Prolog executable.

The only way to debug foreign language code using a debugger is by
starting the debugger on the running core image. Dbx(1) can do this. First
compile the source files to be debugged with the `\tty{-g}' option to
include dbx debugging information. Then load them into SWI-Prolog. Now
obtain the name of the current symbol table and the process id of
Prolog. Then start dbx (or dbxtool) using
\begin{code}
sun% dbx[tool] <symbol file> <pid>
\end{code}

Should this be done often then the following foreign predicate
definition might help:

\begin{boxed}
\begin{code}
pl_dbx()
{ char *symbolfile = PL_query(PL_QUERY_SYMBOLFILE);
  char cmd[256];

  sprintf(cmd, "dbxtool %s %d &", symbolfile, getpid());
  if ( system(cmd) == 0 )
    PL_succeed;
  else
    PL_fail;
}
\end{code}
\end{boxed}

Register this predicate as dbx/0 using the following call in your
initialisation function:

\begin{code}
PL_register_foreign("dbx", 0, pl_dbx, 0);
\end{code}

\subsection{Name Conflicts in C modules}

In the current version of the system all public C functions of
SWI-Prolog are in the symbol table.  This can lead to name clashes with
foreign code.  Someday I should write a program to strip all these
symbols from the symbol table (why does Unix not have that?).  For now
I can only suggest to give your function another name.  You can do this
using the C preprocessor.  If --for example-- your foreign package uses
a function warning(), which happens to exist in SWI-Prolog as well, the
following macro should fix the problem.

\begin{code}
#define warning warning_
\end{code}

\subsection{Compatibility of the Foreign Interface}

As far as I am aware of, there is no standard for foreign language
interfaces in Prolog. The SWI-Prolog interface is no attempt to propose
such a standard. It is (in part) tailored to the possibilities of the
SWI-Prolog machinery. BIM-Prolog has a similar interface to analyse and
construct terms. The major difference is that they have garbage
collection and calls are made available to lock and unlock terms for
garbage collection. I built a similar interface to Edinburgh C-Prolog
(although less clean). This at least tells us that the interface can
work for various forms of the WAM as well as a structure sharing Prolog.

As no standard exists nor emerges, users of the foreign language
interface should carefully design the interface if the C-code should be
portable to other Prolog implementation. The best advice to give is to
define a small interface layer around the C-application and interface
this to Prolog.
