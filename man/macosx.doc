\begin{abstract}
This document briefly explains the MacOS X specific issues for
SWI-Prolog. This is by no means a manual or Prolog tutorial. The
reference manual is available online or can be downloaded in HTML and
PDF format from the \url[SWI-Prolog
website]{http://www.swi-prolog.org/}, which also provides links to
books, online tutorials and other Prolog related material.

\section{Introduction -- Darwinports}

SWI-Prolog is by origin an Unix application, and not a native Macintosh
application.  It has been brought to the Mac using the 
\url[darwinports]{http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/} project, using 
(Macintosh) X11 for its graphical capabilities.

\section{Installation}

\subsection{Using Darwinports}

Users of the Darwinport system can install the system just like any port
using the command below. In addition to the port named
\const{swi-prolog} providing the stable version, there is a port called
\const{swi-prolog-devel} providing the development version.

\begin{code}
% sudo port -d selfupdate       # make sure we have the latest portfiles
% sudo port install swi-prolog
\end{code}

The swi-prolog port depends on \const{readline}, \const{ncurses}
\const{gmp} \const{libmcrypt}, \const{Xfree86} and \const{jpeg}, 

\subsection{From the installer}

Opening and installing the meta installer installs the required ports
from the Darwinport system.  The programs are installed in the directory
\file{/opt/local/bin}.  The main executable is named \file{swipl}.

\section{Running SWI-Prolog}

Not being a Macintosh Application, SWI-Prolog must be started from a
terminal window. This can either be an X11 \program{xterm} or
\textsf{Terminal.app} from Utilities.  For comfortable usage it is
necessary to setup some environment variables.  The procedure depends
on your shell of choice.  On Tiger the default is \program{bash}.  Add
the following lines to the file \file{~/.bashrc} (or create this file
if it does not yet exist).

\begin{code}
# This allows using Prolog graphics if you use Terminal.app
if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ]; then export DISPLAY=:0; fi

# This sets up the path
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin
\end{code}

Now start \textsf{X11.App} and configure it to autostart at login.  Open
\textsf{Terminal.app} or \program{xterm} and type

\begin{code}
% swipl
Welcome to SWI-Prolog (Multi-threaded, Version 5.6.0)
Copyright (c) 1990-2005 University of Amsterdam.
SWI-Prolog comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software,
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
Please visit http://www.swi-prolog.org for details.

For help, use ?- help(Topic). or ?- apropos(Word).

1 ?-
\end{code}

If X11 is properly configure, the help system of the graphics subsystem
XPCE can now be started using the command below.

\begin{code}
?- manpce.
\end{code}


\subsection{Loading a program}

Prolog source files can be loaded by specifying their filename between
\verb$[]$.  In addition to a plain filename, files may be searched on
a named search-path%
	\footnote{See file_search_path/2 in the manual for details.}
using the notation \term{SearchPath}{File}. Two defined paths are
\const{library} for the Prolog library and \const{swi} for the Prolog
installation directory. Below we load the file \file{likes.pl} from the
\file{demo} directory in the installation directory, Be sure to get the
quotes right and terminate the command with a full-stop (\chr{.}).

\begin{code}
?- [swi('demo/likes')].
\end{code}

\subsection{Executing a query}			\label{sec:execquery}

After loading a program, one can ask Prolog queries about the program.
The query below asks Prolog what food `sam' likes. The system responds
with \mbox{\tt X = <value>} if it can prove the goal for a certain
\arg{X}. The user can type the semi-colon (;)%
	\footnote{On most installations, single-character commands are
		  executed without waiting for the {\sc return} key.}
if (s)he wants another solution, or {\sc return} if (s)he is satisfied,
after which Prolog will say {\bf Yes}. If Prolog answers {\bf No}, it
indicates it cannot find any (more) answers to the query. Finally,
Prolog can answer using an error message to indicate the query or
program contains an error.

\begin{code}
?- likes(sam, X).

X = dahl ;

X = tandoori ;

...

X = chips ;

No
?-
\end{code}


\subsection{Editing Prolog programs}		\label{sec:edit}

There are three options for editing. One is to run an editor of choice
in a separate window and use the below described make/0 command to
reload modified files. In addition to this option Prolog can be used to
locate predicates, modules and loaded files by specifying the editor of
choice for use with the edit/1 command described below. This is achieved
by editing the personalisation file \file{~/.plrc}. A commented template
is in the directory \file{dotfiles} of the SWI-Prolog installation
directory.

Finally, you may wish to use the built-in editor called \emph{PceEmacs}.
This editor provides colourisation support based on real-time parsing
and cross-reference analysis of the program. It is started using the
command \verb$?- emacs.$ or can be set as default editor in the
personalisation file.


\subsection{Some useful commands}

This section provides a very brief overview of important or
commonly used SWI-Prolog predicates to control the environment.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{consult}{1}{+File}
Load a source-file. A Prolog list ([\ldots]) can be used to abbreviate
the consult command. The file-extension (\fileext{pl} can be omitted.
Here are some examples:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt ?- consult(likes). & Load \file{likes.pl} from the current folder
			 (see pwd/0). \\
\tt ?- ['/opt/local/lib/swipl-5.6.0/demo/likes'] & Load \file{likes.pl} using
			absolute path. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

    \predicate{pwd}{0}{}
Print working directory (folder).

    \predicate{ls}{0}{}
List files in current directory.

    \predicate{edit}{0}{}
If Prolog is started by opening a \fileext{pl} file in the explorer,
edit this file.  Also available from the menu.

    \predicate{edit}{1}{+Spec}
Edit file, predicate, module, etc.\ with the given name.  If multiple
items are named \arg{Spec} it prompts for the desired alternative.

    \predicate{make}{0}{}
Reload all files that have been changed since they where last loaded.
Normally used after editing one or more files.

    \predicate{trace}{0}{}
Start the interactive debugger.  There are three ways to use this.
Entered as a single goal at the toplevel, the next query will be
traced.  Alternatively it can be used in conjunction with the goal
to be debugged: \exam{?- trace, run.} and finally you can include it
in your program to start tracing at a particular point or under a
particular condition:

\begin{code}
	...,
	(var(X) -> trace ; true),
	...,
\end{code}

    \predicate{gtrace}{0}{}
Same as trace, but forces the use of the graphical (source-level)
debugger.

    \predicate{apropos}{1}{+Keyword}
Search for all predicates that contain \arg{Keyword} in their name
or short description.  If a gui environment is available the results
are hyperlinks.  Otherwise use help/1 to get details on selected
hits.

    \predicate{help}{1}{+Spec}
Give help on \arg{Spec}, which is normally the name of a predicate or
C interface function.
\end{description}


\section{Using SWI-Prolog with C/C++}

To use SWI-Prolog with C or C++ code you must install Apples xcode
environment, providing \program{gcc}. If all paths are properly
installed, programs can be linked using the \program{plld} command
described in the manual.


\section{The SWI-Prolog community and foundation}

\subsection{Web-site and mailinglists}

The SWI-Prolog web-site is located at \url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/}.
Part of the web is powered by \url[TWiki]{http://twiki.org/}, a
\emph{wiki} web that can be edited by any registered user and used to
exchange ideas, problems and solutions.  The web also provides access
to the archive of the mailinglist and allows to (de)register the
mailinglist.  Finally, it incorporates Bugzilla, the Mozilla project
bugtracking system, for reporting bugs and tracking issues.


\subsection{About license conditions}

The SWI-Prolog license allows it to be used in a wide variety of
environments, including closed-source commercial applications. In
practice, redistribution and embedding is allowed, as long as
\emph{modifications} to the SWI-Prolog source are published following
the Free Software rules.

The SWI-Prolog kernel and foreign libraries are licensed under the
\emph{Lesser General Public License} (LGPL).  The Prolog files are
licensed under the normal \emph{General Public License} GPL with
an additional statement that allows for embedding in proprietary
software:

\begin{quote}
    As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
    compiled with a Free Software compiler, to produce an executable, this
    library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered
    by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however
    invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
    the GNU General Public License.
\end{quote}

This exception is a proven construct used for \emph{libgcc}, the GNU
C-compiler runtime library.
