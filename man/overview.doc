\chapter{Overview}

\section{Starting SWI-Prolog from the Unix Shell}

It is advised to install SWI-Prolog as `pl' in the local binary
directory. SWI-Prolog can then be started from the Unix shell by typing
`\file{pl}'. The system will boot from the system's default boot
file, perform the necessary initialisations and then enter the
interactive top level.

After the necessary system initialisation the system consults (see
consult/1) the user's initialisation file. This initialisation file
should be named `\file{.plrc}' and reside either in the current
directory or in the user's home directory. If both exist the
initialisation file from the current directory is loaded. The name of
the initialisation file can be changed with the `\argoption{-f}{file}'
option. After loading the initialisation file SWI-Prolog executes a user
initialisation goal. The default goal is a system predicate that prints
the banner message. The default can be modified with the
`\argoption{-g}{goal}' option. Next the toplevel goal is started.
Default is the interactive Prolog loop (see prolog/0). The user can
overwrite this default with the `\argoption{-t}{toplevel}' option.

\subsection{Command Line Options}

The full set of command line options is given below:

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-help}{}
When given as the only option, it summarises the most important options.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-v}{}
When given as the only option, it summarises the version and the
architecture identifier.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-arch}{}
When given as the only option, it prints the architecture identifier
(see feature(arch, Arch)) and exits.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-L}{size}
Give local stack size in K bytes (2000 K default). Note that there is no
space between the size option and its argument.  For machines with
dynamic stack allocation this flag sets the maximum value to which the
stack is allowed to grow (2 Mbytes default).  A maximum is useful to
stop buggy programs from claiming all memory resources.  \cmdlineoption{-L0} sets
the limit to the highest possible value.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-G}{size}
Give global stack size in K bytes (4000 K default).  For machines with
dynamic stack allocation the default is 4 Mbytes. See \cmdlineoption{-L} for more
details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-T}{size}
Give trail stack size in K bytes (4000 K default).  For machines with
dynamic stack allocation the default is 4 Mbytes. See \cmdlineoption{-L} for more
details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-A}{size}
Give argument stack size in K bytes (1000 K default).  For machines with
dynamic stack allocation the default is 1 Mbytes. See \cmdlineoption{-L} for more
details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-c}{file \ldots}
Compile files into an `intermediate code file'. See \secref{compilation}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-o}{output}
Used in combination with \cmdlineoption{-c} or \cmdlineoption{-b} to determine output file
for compilation.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-O}{}
Optimised compilation. See please/3.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-f}{file}
Use \arg{file} as initialisation file instead of `\file{.plrc}'.
`\argoption{-f}{none}' stops SWI-Prolog from searching for an
initialisation file.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-F}{script}
Selects a startup-script from the SWI-Prolog home directory. The
script-file is named \file{<script>.rc}. The default
\arg{script} name is deduced from the executable, taking the leading
alphanumerical characters (letters, digits and underscore) from the
program-name. \argoption{-F}{none} stops looking for a script. Intended
for simple management of slightly different versions. One could for
example write a script \file{iso.rc} and then select ISO compatibility
mode using \exam{pl -F iso} or make a link from \program{iso-pl} to
\program{pl}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-g}{goal}
\arg{Goal} is executed just before entering the top level. Default is a
predicate which prints the welcome message. The welcome message can
thus be suppressed by giving \argoption{-g}{true}. \arg{goal} can be a complex
term. In this case quotes are normally needed to protect it from
being expanded by the Unix shell. 

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-t}{goal}
Use \arg{goal} as interactive toplevel instead of the default goal
prolog/0. \arg{goal} can be a complex term. If the toplevel goal
succeeds SWI-Prolog exits with status 0. If it fails the exit status is 1.
This flag also determines the goal started by break/0 and abort/0. If
you want to stop the user from entering interactive mode start the
application with `\argoption{-g}{goal}' and give `halt' as toplevel.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-tty}{}
Switches tty control (using ioctl(2)) on (\cmdlineoption{+tty}) or off
(\cmdlineoption{-tty}). Normally tty control is switched on. This default
depends on the installation.  You may wish to switch tty control off if
Prolog is used from an editor such as Emacs.  If switched off
get_single_char/1 and the tracer will wait for a return.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-x}{bootfile}
Boot from \arg{bootfile} instead of the system's default boot file. A
bootfile is a file resulting from a Prolog compilation using the
\cmdlineoption{-b} or \cmdlineoption{-c} option or a program saved using
qsave_program/[1,2].

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-r}{restorefile}
Restore a state created by save_program/[1,2] or save/[1,2] using
the new-style saved-states.  Equivalent to \exam{restore(restorefile)} from
Prolog.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-p}{alias=path1[:path2 \ldots]}
Define a path alias for file_search_path. \arg{alias} is the name of
the alias, \arg{path1 ...} is a \chr{:} separated list of values for
the alias.  A value is either a term of the form \mbox{alias(value)}
or pathname.  The computed aliases are added to file_search_path/2
using asserta/1, so they precede predefined values for the alias.  See
file_search_path/2 for details on using this file-location mechanism.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{{\tt --}}{}
Stops scanning for more arguments, so you can pass arguments for your
application after this one.
\end{description}

The following options are for system maintenance. They are given
for reference only.

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-b}{initfile \ldots \cmdlineoption{-c} file \ldots}
Boot compilation.  \arg{initfile \ldots} are compiled by the C-written
bootstrap compiler, \arg{file \ldots} by the normal Prolog compiler.
System maintenance only.
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-d}{level}
Set debug level to \arg{level}. Only has effect if the system is
compiled with the \const{-DO_DEBUG} flag. System maintenance
only.
\end{description}


\section{GNU Emacs Interface}

\index{GNU-Emacs}\index{Emacs}
A provisional interface to \program{emacs} has been included since
version 1.6 of SWI-Prolog. The interface is based on the freely
distributed interface delivered with Quintus Prolog. When running Prolog
as an inferior process under GNU-Emacs, there is support for finding
predicate definitions, completing atoms, finding the locations of
compilation-warnings and many more. For details, see the files
\file{pl/lisp/README} and \file{pl/lisp/swi-prolog.el}. 


\section{Online Help}

Online help provides a fast lookup and browsing facility to this
manual. The online manual can show predicate definitions as well as
entire sections of the manual.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{help}{0}{}
Equivalent to \exam{help(help/1)}.

    \predicate{help}{1}{+What}
Show specified part of the manual.  \arg{What} is one of:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
<Name>/<Arity>  & give help on specified predicate \\
<Name>          & give help on named predicate with any arity
                  or C interface function with that name \\
<Section>       & display specified section. section numbers are
                  dash-separated numbers: \exam{2-3} refers to
                  section 2.3 of the manual.  Section numbers are
                  obtained using apropos/1.
\end{tabular}\end{center}

Examples
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
\exam{?- help(assert).}    & give help on predicate assert \\
\exam{?- help(3-4).}       & display section 3.4 of the manual \\
\exam{?- help('PL_retry').}& give help on interface function PL_retry() \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}

    \predicate{apropos}{1}{+Pattern}
Display all predicates, functions and sections that have {\em
Pattern} in their name or summary description.  Lowercase letters in
\arg{Pattern} also match a corresponding uppercase letter. Example:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
\exam{?- apropos(file).}   & Display predicates, functions and sections
                            that have `file' (or `File', etc.) in their
                            summary description. \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}

    \predicate{explain}{1}{+ToExplain}
Give an explanation on the given `object'.  The argument may be
any Prolog data object.  If the argument is an atom, a term of
the form \arg{Name/Arity} or a term of the form {\em
Module:Name/Arity}, explain will try to explain the predicate
as well as possible references to it.

    \predicate{explain}{2}{+ToExplain, -Explanation}
Unify \arg{Explanation} with an explanation for \arg{ToExplain}.
Backtracking yields further explanations.
\end{description}


\section{Query Substitutions}
\label{sec:history}

SWI-Prolog offers a query substitution mechanism similar to that
of Unix csh (csh(1)), called `history'. It allows the user to compose
new queries from those typed before and remembered by the system. It
also allows to correct queries and syntax errors. SWI-Prolog does not
offer the Unix csh capabilities to include arguments. This is omitted
as it is unclear how the first, second, etc.\ argument should be
defined.%
    \footnote{One could choose words, defining words as a sequence of
              alpha-numeric characters and the word separators as
              anything else, but one could also choose Prolog
              arguments}

The available history commands are shown in \tabref{history}.
\Figref{history} gives some examples.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\verb+!!.+            & Repeat last query \\
\verb+!nr.+           & Repeat query numbered <nr> \\
\verb+!str.+          & Repeat last query starting with <str> \\
\verb+!?str.+         & Repeat last query holding <str> \\
\verb+^old^new.+      & Substitute <old> into <new> of
                        last query \\
\verb+!nr^old^new.+   & Substitute in query numbered <nr> \\
\verb+!str^old^new.+  & Substitute in query starting with <str> \\
\verb+!?str^old^new.+ & Substitute in query holding <str> \\
\verb+h.+             & Show history list \\
\verb+!h.+            & Show this list \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Limitations of the History System}

When in top level SWI-Prolog reads the user's queries using
read_history/6 rather than read/1.  This predicate first reads the
current input stream up to a full stop.  While doing so it maps all
contiguous blank space onto a single space and deletes
\exam{/* \ldots */} and \exam{\% \ldots <cr>} comments.  Parts between double quotes
(\const{"}) or single quotes (\const{'}) are left unaltered.  Note that a
Prolog full stop consists of a `non-symbol' character, followed by a
period (\const{.}), followed by a blank character.  `Symbol' characters
are: \verb!#$&*+-./:<=>?@^`~!. A single quote immediately preceded by
a digit (0-9) is considered part of the \mbox{<digit>'<digit>\ldots}
(e.g.\ \exam{2'101}; binary number 101) sequence.

After this initial parsing the result is first checked for the special
\mbox{\Shat<old>\Shat<new>.} construction. If this fails the
string is checked for all occurrences of the \const{!}, followed by a
\const{!}, \const{?}, a digit, a letter or an underscore. These special
sequences are analysed and the appropriate substitution from the history
list is made.

From the above it follows that it is hard or impossible to
correct quotation with single or double quotes, comment delimiters and
spacing.


\section{Reuse of toplevel bindings}    \label{sec:topvars}

Bindings resulting from the successful execution of a toplevel goal
are asserted in a database.  These values may be reused in further
toplevel queries as \$Var.  Only the latest binding is available.
Example:

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
1 ?- maplist(plus(1), "hello", X).

X = [105,102,109,109,112] 

2 ?- format('~s~n', [$X]).
ifmmp
\end{code}
    \caption{Reusing toplevel bindings}
    \label{fig:topevelvars}
\end{figure} 

Note that variables may be set by executing \predref{=}{2}:

\begin{code}
6 ?- X = statistics.

X = statistics

7 ?- $X.

Trail  stack :    4,096,000        8,192          432 Bytes
\end{code}

\section{Overview of the Debugger}

SWI-Prolog has a standard 4-port tracer \cite{Clocksin:81} with an
optional fifth port. This fifth port, called \arg{unify} allows the user
to inspect the result after unification of the head. The ports are
called \const{call}, \const{exit}, \const{redo}, \const{fail} and
\const{unify}. The tracer is started by the trace/0 command, when a spy
point is reached and the system is in debugging mode (see spy/1 and
debug/0) or when an error is detected at run time. Note that in the
interactive toplevel goal trace/0 means ``trace the next query''. The
tracer shows the port, displaying the port name, the current depth of
the recursion and the goal. The goal is printed using the Prolog
predicate print/1 (default), write/1 or display/1. An example using all
five ports is shown in \figref{tracer}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
Yes
2 ?- visible(+all), leash(-exit).

Yes
3 ?- trace, min([3, 2], X).
  Call:  ( 3) min([3, 2], G235) ? creep
  Unify: ( 3) min([3, 2], G235)
  Call:  ( 4) min([2], G244) ? creep
  Unify: ( 4) min([2], 2)
  Exit:  ( 4) min([2], 2)
  Call:  ( 4) min(3, 2, G235) ? creep
  Unify: ( 4) min(3, 2, G235)
  Call:  ( 5) 3 < 2 ? creep
  Fail:  ( 5) 3 < 2 ? creep
  Redo:  ( 4) min(3, 2, G235) ? creep
  Exit:  ( 4) min(3, 2, 2)
  Exit:  ( 3) min([3, 2], 2)
\end{code}
    \caption{Example trace}
    \label{fig:tracer}
\end{figure}

On {\em leashed ports} (set with the predicate leash/1, default are
\const{call}, \const{exit}, \const{redo} and \const{fail}) the user is
prompted for an action. All actions are single character commands which
are executed {\bf without} waiting for a return (Unix `cbreak' mode),
unless the command line option \cmdlineoption{-tty} is active. Tracer options:

\begin{description}
    \traceoption{+}{Spy}{
Set a spy point (see spy/1) on the current predicate.} 
    \traceoption{-}{No spy}{
Remove the spy point (see nospy/1) from the current predicate.} 
    \traceoption{/}{Find}{
Search for a port.  After the `/', the user can enter a line
to specify the port to search for.  This line consists of a set of
letters indicating the port type, followed by an optional term,
that should unify with the goal run by the port.  If no term is
specified it is taken as a variable, searching for any port of the
specified type.  If an atom is given, any goal whose functor has a
name equal to that atom matches.  Examples:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3in}}
\tt /f                  & Search for any fail port \\
\tt /fe solve           & Search for a fail or exit port of any goal with
                          name \const{solve} \\
\tt /c solve(a, _)      & Search for a call to {solve}/2 whose first argument
                          is a variable or the atom \const{a} \\
\tt /a member(_, _)     & Search for any port on member/2. This is equivalent
                          to setting a spy point on member/2. \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}}
    \traceoption{.}{Repeat find}{
Repeat the last find command (see `/')}
    \traceoption{A}{Alternatives}{
Show all goals that have alternatives.} 
    \traceoption{C}{Context}{
Toggle `Show Context'. If \const{on} the context module of the goal is
displayed between square brackets (see \secref{modules}).
Default is \const{off}.} 
    \traceoption{L}{Listing}{
List the current predicate with listing/1.} 
    \traceoption{a}{Abort}{
Abort Prolog execution (see abort/0).} 
    \traceoption{b}{Break}{
Enter a Prolog break environment (see break/0).} 
    \traceoption{c}{Creep}{
Continue execution, stop at next port. (Also return, space).} 
    \traceoption{d}{Display}{
Write goals using the Prolog predicate display/1.} 
    \traceoption{e}{Exit}{
Terminate Prolog (see halt/0).} 
    \traceoption{f}{Fail}{
Force failure of the current goal} 
    \traceoption{g}{Goals}{
Show the list of parent goals (the execution stack). Note that due to tail
recursion optimization a number of parent goals might not exist any more.} 
    \traceoption{h}{Help}{
Show available options (also `?').} 
    \traceoption{i}{Ignore}{
Ignore the current goal, pretending it succeeded.} 
    \traceoption{l}{Leap}{
Continue execution, stop at next spy point.} 
    \traceoption{n}{No debug}{
Continue execution in `no debug' mode.} 
    \traceoption{p}{Print}{
Write goals using the Prolog predicate print/1 (default).} 
    \traceoption{r}{Retry}{
Undo all actions (except for database and i/o actions) back to the call
port of the current goal and resume execution at the call port.} 
    \traceoption{s}{Skip}{
Continue execution, stop at the next port of {\bf this} goal (thus skipping
all calls to children of this goal).} 
    \traceoption{u}{Up}{
Continue execution, stop at the next port of {\bf the parent} goal (thus
skipping this goal and all calls to children of this goal). This option
is useful to stop tracing a failure driven loop.} 
    \traceoption{w}{Write}{
Write goals using the Prolog predicate write/1.} 
\end{description}

The ideal 4 port model as described in many Prolog books
\cite{Clocksin:81} is not visible in many Prolog implementations because
code optimisation removes part of the choice- and exit points.
Backtrack points are not shown if either the goal succeeded
deterministically or its alternatives were removed using the cut.  When
running in debug mode (debug/0) choice points are only destroyed when
removed by the cut.  In debug mode tail recursion optimisation is
switched off.%
    \footnote{This implies the system can run out of local stack in debug
              mode, while no problems arise when running in non-debug mode.}

\section{Compilation}			\label{sec:compilation}

Collections of SWI-Prolog source files can be compiled into an
\jargon{intermediate code file}. An intermediate code file is a data
file from which SWI-Prolog can be started. The command to compile a
bundle of source files is:

\begin{code}
pl [options] [-o output] -c file ...
\end{code}

The individual source files may include other files using the standard
list notation, consult/1, ensure_loaded/1 and use_module/[1,2]. When the
\argoption{-o}{file} option is omitted a file named \file{a.out} is
created that holds the intermediate code file.

Intermediate code files start with the BSD Unix magic code \const{#!}
and are executable. This implies they can be started as a command:

\begin{code}
% pl -o my_program -c ...
...
% my_program [options]
\end{code}

Alternatively, {\tt my_program} can be started with
\begin{code}
% pl -x my_program [options]
\end{code}

The following restrictions apply to source files that are to be
compiled with `\cmdlineoption{-c}':

\begin{itemize}
    \item
term_expansion/2 should not use assert/1 and or retract/1 other than
for local computational purposes.
    \item
Files can only be included by the standard include directives: [...],
consult/1, ensure_loaded/1 and use_module/[1,2].  User defined loading
predicate invocations will not be compiled.
\end{itemize}

Directives are executed both when compiling the program and when
loading the intermediate code file.

\section{Environment Control}

The current system defines 3 different mechanisms to query and/or set
properties of the environment: please/3, flag/3 and feature/2 as well as
a number of special purpose predicates of which unknown/2, fileerrors/2
are examples.  The ISO standard defines prolog_flag.  It is likely that
all these global features will be merged into a single in the future.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{please}{3}{+Key, -Old, +New}
The predicate please/3%
    \footnote{The idea comes from BIM_Prolog. The options supported by
              this predicate are not compatible with those for
              BIM_Prolog however.}
is a solution to avoid large numbers of environment control
predicates. Later versions will support other environment control as
now provided via the predicates style_check/1, leash/1, unknown/2, the
tracer predicates, etc. These predicates are then moved into a library
for backwards compatibility. The currently available options are:

\begin{description}
    \pleaseoption{optimise}{on/off}{off}
Switch optimise mode for the compiler \const{on} or \const{off} (see also
the command line option \cmdlineoption{-O}). Currently optimise compilation only
implies compilation of arithmetic, making it fast, but invisible to the
tracer.  Later versions might imply various other optimisations such as
incorporating a number of basic predicates in the virtual machine
(var/1, fail/0, =/2, etc.)  to gain speed at the cost of crippling the
debugger.  Also source level optimisations such as integrating small
predicates into their callers, eliminating constant expressions and
other predictable constructs.  Source code optimisation is never
applied to predicates that are declared dynamic (see dynamic/1).
    \pleaseoption{autoload}{on/off}{on}
If \const{on} autoloading of library functions is enabled. If
\const{off} autoloading is disabled. See \secref{autoload}.
    \pleaseoption{verbose_autoload}{on/off}{off}
If \const{on} the normal consult message will be printed if a library is
autoloaded.  By default this message is suppressed.  Intended to be used
for debugging purposes (e.g.\ where does this predicate come from?).
\end{description}

    \predicate{feature}{2}{?Key, -Value}
The predicate feature/2 defines an interface to installation features:
options compiled in, version, home, etc.  With both arguments unbound,
it will generate all defined features.  With the `Key' instantiated it
unify the value of the feature.  Features come in three types: boolean
features, features with an atom value and features with an integer
value. A boolean feature is true iff the feature is present {\bf and}
the \arg{Value} is the atom \const{true}. Currently defined keys:

\begin{description}
    \featureoption{arch}{atom}
Identifier for the hardware and operating system SWI-Prolog is running
on.  Used to determine the startup file as well as to select foreign
files for the right architecture.  See also load_foreign/5.
    \featureoption{version}{integer}
The version identifier is an integer with value: $$10000 \times
\arg{Major} + 100 \times \arg{Minor} + \arg{Patch}$$
Note that in releases upto 2.7.10 this feature yielded an atom holding
the three numbers separated by dots. The current representation is much
easier for implementing version-conditional statements.
    \featureoption{home}{atom}
SWI-Prolog's notion of the home-directory.  SWI-Prolog uses it's home
directory to find its startup file as \file{<home>/startup/startup.<arch>}
and to find its library as \file{<home>/library}.
    \featureoption{pipe}{bool}
If true, tell(pipe(command)), etc.\ are supported.
    \featureoption{load_foreign}{bool}
If true, load_foreign/[2,5] are implemented.
    \featureoption{open_shared_object}{bool}
If true, open_shared_object/2 and friends are implemented, providing
access to shared libraries (.so files).  This requires the C-library
functions dlopen() and friends as well as the configuration option
{\tt --with-dlopen}.
    \featureoption{dynamic_stacks}{bool}
If true, the system provides virtual memory based stack expansion.  This
makes stack-expansion safe when called from C and while running
C-defined functions without these functions taking any precautions.
Pure Prolog programs are not affected by this feature as the system
will use stack-shifting to expand the stacks at runtime.
    \featureoption{c_libs}{atom}
Libraries passed to the C-linker when SWI-Prolog was linked.  May be used
to determine the libraries needed to create statically linked extensions
for SWI-Prolog.
    \featureoption{c_staticlibs}{atom}
On some machines, the SWI-Prolog executable is dynamically linked, but
requires some libraries to be statically linked.
    \featureoption{c_cc}{atom}
Name of the C-compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog.  Normally either gcc
or cc.
    \featureoption{c_ldflags}{atom}
Special linker flags passed to link SWI-Prolog.
    \featureoption{save}{bool}
If true, save/[1,2] is implemented.
    \featureoption{save_program}{bool}
If true, save_program/[1,2] is implemented.
    \featureoption{readline}{bool}
If true, SWI-Prolog is linked with the readline library.  This is done
by default if you have this library installed on your system.
    \featureoption{saved_program}{bool}
If true, Prolog is started from a state saved with qsave_program/[1,2].
    \featureoption{runtime}{bool}
If true, SWI-Prolog is compiled with -DO_RUNTIME, disabling various
useful development features (currently the tracer and profiler).
    \featureoption{max_integer}{integer}
Maximum integer value.  Most arithmetic operations will automatically
convert to floats if integer values above this are returned.
    \featureoption{min_integer}{integer}
Minimum integer value.
    \featureoption{max_tagged_integer}{integer}
Maximum integer value represented as a `tagged' value.  Tagged integers
require 4-bytes storage and are used for indexing.  Larger integers are
represented as `indirect data' and require 16-bytes on the stacks (though
a copy requires only 4 additional bytes).
    \featureoption{min_tagged_integer}{integer}
Start of the tagged-integer value range.
    \featureoption{float_format}{atom}
C {\tt printf()} format specification used by write/1 and friends to
determine how floating point numbers are printed.  The default is {\tt
\%g}.  May be changed.  The specified value is passed to printf()
without further checking.  For example, if you want more digits printed,
{\tt \%.12g} will print all floats using 12 digits instead of the
default 6.  See also format/[1,2], write/1, print/1 and portray/1.
    \featureoption{compiled_at}{atom}
Describes when the system has been compiled. Only available if the
C-compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog provides the __DATE__ and __TIME__
macros.
    \featureoption{character_escapes}{bool}
If true (default), read/1 interprets \verb$\$ escape sequences in quoted
atoms and strings.  May be changed.
    \featureoption{gc}{bool}
If true (default), the garbage collector is active.  If false, neither
garbage-collection, nor stack-shifts will take place, even not on
explicit request.  May be changed.
    \featureoption{trace_gc}{bool}
If true (false is the default), garbage collections and stack-shifts
will be reported on the terminal.  May be changed.
    \featureoption{max_arity}{unbounded}
ISO feature describing there is no maximum arity to compound terms.
    \featureoption{integer_rounding_function}{down,toward_zero}
ISO feature describing rounding by \verb$//$ and \verb$rem$ arithmetic
functions. Value depends on the C-compiler used.
    \featureoption{bounded}{true}
ISO feature describing integer representation is bound by
{\tt min_integer} and {\tt min_integer}.
    \featureoption{tty_control}{bool}
Determines whether the terminal is switched to raw mode for
get_single_char/1, which also reads the user-actions for the trace.  May
be set.  See also the \cmdlineoption{+/-tty} command-line option.
    \featureoption{debug_on_error}{bool}
If {\tt true}, start the tracer after an error is detected.  Otherwise
just continue execution.  The goal that raised the error will normally
fail.  See also fileerrors/2 and the feature {\tt report_error}.  May
be changed.  Default is {\tt true}, except for the runtime version.
    \featureoption{report_error}{bool}
If {\tt true}, print error messages, otherwise suppress them.  May be
changed.  See also the {\tt debug_on_error} feature.  Default is {\tt
true}, except for the runtime version.  
    \featureoption{unix}{bool}
\index{unix}%
If {\tt true}, the operating system is some version of Unix.  Defined
if the C-compiler used to compile this version of SWI-Prolog either
defines \verb$__unix__$ or \const{unix}.
    \featureoption{windows}{bool}
\index{windows}%
If {\tt true}, the operating system is an implementation of Microsoft
Windows (3.1, 95, NT, etc.).
\end{description}

    \predicate{set_feature}{2}{+Key, +Value}
Define a new feature or change its value. Both arguments must be atoms.
\end{description}


\section{Saved States}


\subsection{Types of Saved States and Portability}

On some architectures, SWI-Prolog allows for the creation of saved
states.  Currently, the C-sources define two alternative
implementations for them.  The old implementation%
  \footnote{This implementation is based on GNU's unexec() function,
            creating a new executable from the running process.  It
            is selected using the \const{O_STORE_PROGRAM} option in the
            machine-description file.}
creates an entirely self-contained executable.  It supports only the
save_program/[1,2] predicates.  The new implementation%
  \footnote{This implementation is selected by the O_SAVE option in
            the machine-description file.}
creates a file that is read by the `base' program.  This file contains
the data-area of the SWI-Prolog process and optionally the Prolog-
and C stacks.  This implementation supports save_program/[1,2],
save/[1,2] and restore/1.  The state-file depends entirely on {\em
exactly} the Unix program-file used to create it.


\subsection{Save Predicates}

\begin{description}
\predicate{save_program}{2}{+NewProgram, +ListOfOptions}
Create a new executable which will be named \arg{NewProgram}.
\arg{ListOfOptions} is a list of \mbox{\arg{Key} = \arg{Value}} pairs that
specify the default command line options that will be saved into the new
program. If a default is not specified the default compiled into the
currently running Prolog executable is used.%
    \footnote{These are NOT the defaults compiled into an intermediate
              code file created with pl -c ...}
The available keys are given in \tabref{save-options}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|l|}
\hline
\bf Key & \bf Option    & \bf Type      & \bf Description \\
\hline
local   & \bf -L        & K-bytes       & Size (Limit) of local stack \\
global  & \bf -G        & K-bytes       & Size (Limit) of global stack \\
trail   & \bf -T        & K-bytes       & Size (Limit) of trail stack \\
argument& \bf -A        & K-bytes       & Size (Limit) of argument stack \\
goal    & \bf -g        & atom          & Initialisation goal \\
toplevel& \bf -t        & atom          & Prolog toplevel goal \\
init_file& \bf -f       & atom          & Personal initialisation file \\
tty     & \bf +/--tty   & on/off        & Use ioctl(2) calls \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

    \caption{Key = Value pairs for save_program/2}
    \label{tab:save-options}
\end{table}

As the entire data image of the current process will be saved on the new
executable it is desirable to keep this small.  Notably the Prolog
machine stacks should be kept small.  The best way to do this is first
to compile the program using the \cmdlineoption{-c} option.  If this is not
possible try to find the smallest possible stack sizes to compile the
program.  On machines with dynamic stack allocation the stacks are {\bf
not} written to file and so their size does not matter.
\Figref{create-stand} shows a possible session.  Note the use of
`initialise', which is supposed to be a predicate of the application
doing time consuming initialisation.

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
sun% pl -c load
foreign file dbase loaded 0.066667 seconds, 1578 bytes.
setup consulted, 0.500000 seconds, 5091 bytes.
main consulted, 0.333333 seconds, 3352 bytes.

2 ?- save_program(my_program,
        [ local     = 500

        , init_file = none
        ]).

2 ?- halt.

\end{code}
    \caption{Create a stand-alone executable}
    \label{fig:create-stand}
\end{figure}

The resulting program can be used for incremental compilation using
\cmdlineoption{-c} or another save_program/2.

    \predicate{save_program}{1}{+NewProgram}
Equivalent to `\verb$save_program(NewProgram, [])$'.

    \predicate{save}{1}{+State}
Writes the current status on the program, Prolog- and C-stacks to
the file \arg{State}.  When this file is restored, save/1 succeeds
in the restored state and execution continues as illustrated by the
following example:

\begin{code}
1 ?- save(state), format('Hello World~n').
Hello World

Yes
2 ?- halt.
machine% ./state
Hello World

Yes
2 ?- h.
    1   save(state), format('Hello World~n').
2 ?- 
\end{code}

The save/1 predicate is normally used for debugging purposes.
save_program/[1,2] is the preferred way to create a new program.

    \predicate{save}{2}{+State, -Rval}
Like save/1, but unifies \arg{Rval} with 0 when save/2 returns from a
real save and with 1 when save/2 returns from a restore.

    \predicate{restore}{1}{+State}
Equivalent to restarting \arg{State}.
\end{description}


\section{Automatic loading of libraries}
\label{sec:autoload}

If ---at runtime--- an undefined predicate is trapped the system will
first try to import the predicate from the module's default module.
If this fails the \jargon{auto loader} is activated.  On first activation
an index to all library files in all library directories is loaded in
core (see library_directory/1).  If the undefined predicate can be
located in the one of the libraries that library file is automatically
loaded and the call to the (previously undefined) predicate is
resumed.  By default this mechanism loads the file silently.  The
please/3 option \const{verbose_autoload} is provided to get verbose
loading. The please option \const{autoload} can be used to
enable/disable the entire auto load system.

Autoloading only handles (library) source files that use the module
mechanism described in \chapref{modules}.  The files are loaded
with use_module/2 and only the trapped undefined predicate will be imported
to the module where the undefined predicate was called.  Each library
directory must hold a file \file{INDEX.pl} that contains an index to all
library files in the directory.  This file consists of lines of the 
following format:

\begin{code}
index(Name, Arity, Module, File).
\end{code}

The predicate make/0 scans the autoload libraries and updates the
index if it exists, is writable and out-of-date.  It is advised to
create an empty file called \file{INDEX.pl} in a library directory
meant for auto loading before doing anything else.  This index file
can then be updated by running the prolog make_library_index/1 (`\%' is
the Unix prompt):

\begin{code}
% mkdir ~/lib/prolog
% cd !$
% pl -g true -t 'make_library_index(.)'
\end{code}

If there are more than one library files containing the desired predicate
the following search schema is followed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If a there is a library file that defines the module in which
        the undefined predicate is trapped, this file is used.
  \item Otherwise library files are considered in the order they appear
        in the library_directory/1 predicate and within the directory
        alphabetically.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{make_library_index}{1}{+Directory}
Create an index for this directory.  The index is written to the file
'INDEX.pl' in the specified directory.  Fails with a warning if the
directory does not exist or is write protected.
\end{description}


\subsection{Notes on Automatic Loading}

The autoloader is a new feature to SWI-Prolog.  Its aim is to simplify
program development and program management.  Common lisp has a similar
feature, but here the user has to specify which library is to be
loaded if a specific function is called which is not defined.  The
advantage of the SWI-Prolog schema is that the user does not have to
specify this.  The disadvantage however is that the user might be
wondering ``where the hell this predicate comes from''.  Only
experience can learn whether the functionality of the autoloader is
appropriate.  Comments are welcome.

The autoloader only works if the unknown flag (see unknown/2) is set to
\const{trace} (default).  A more appropriate interaction with this flag
will be considered.


\section{Garbage Collection}

SWI-Prolog version 1.4 was the first release to support garbage
collection.  Together with tail-recursion optimisation this guaranties
forward chaining programs do not waste indefinite amounts of memory.
Previous releases of this manual stressed on using failure-driven
loops in those cases that no information needed to be passed to the
next iteration via arguments.  This to avoid large amounts of garbage.
This is no longer strictly necessary, but it should be noticed that
garbage collection is a time consuming activity.  Failure driven loops
tend to be faster for this reason.


\section{Syntax Notes}

SWI-Prolog uses standard `Edinburgh' syntax. A description of this
syntax can be found in the Prolog books referenced in the introduction.
Below are some non-standard or non-common constructs that are accepted
by SWI-Prolog:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [\exam{0'<char>}]
This construct is not accepted by all Prolog systems that claim to have
Edinburgh compatible syntax. It describes the ASCII value of <char>.
To test whether \chr{C} is a lower case character one can use
\exam{between(0'a, 0'z, C)}.
    \item [\exam{/* \ldots /* \ldots */ \ldots */}]
The \exam{/* \ldots */} comment statement can be nested. This is useful
if some code with \exam{/* \ldots */} comment statements in it should be
commented out.
\end{itemlist}

\subsection{ISO Syntax Support}

SWI-Prolog offers ISO compatible extensions to the Edinburgh syntax.

\subsubsection{Character Escape Syntax} \label{sec:charescapes}

Within quoted atoms (using single quotes: \exam{'<atom>'} special
characters are represented using escape-sequences.  An escape sequence
is lead in by the backslash (\chr{\}) character. The list of
escape sequences is compatible with the ISO standard, but contains one
extension and the interpretation of numerically specified characters is
slightly more flexible to improve compatibility.

\begin{description}
    \escapeitem{a}
Alert character.  Normally the ASCII character 7 (beep).
    \escapeitem{b}
Backspace character.
    \escapeitem{c}
No output.  All input characters upto but not including the first
non-layout character are skipped.  This allows for the specification
of pretty-looking long lines.  For compatibility with Quintus Prolog.
Nor supported by ISO.  Example:
\begin{code}
format('This is a long line that would look better if it was \c
       split across multiple physical lines in the input')
\end{code}
    \escapeitem{\bnfmeta{{\sc RETURN}}}
No output.  Skips input till the next non-layout character or to the
end of the next line.  Same intention as \fmtseq{\c} but ISO compatible.
    \escapeitem{f}
Form-feed character.
    \escapeitem{n}
Next-line character.
    \escapeitem{r}
Carriage-return only (i.e.\ go back to the start of the line).
    \escapeitem{t}
Horizontal tab-character.
    \escapeitem{v}
Vertical tab-character (ASCII 11).
    \escapeitem{x23}
Hexadecimal specification of a character. \verb$23$ is just an example.
The `x' may be followed by a maximum of 2 hexadecimal digits.  The
closing \verb$\$ is optional.  The code \verb$\xa\3$ emits the character
10 (hexadecimal `a') followed by `3'.  The code \verb$\x201$ emits
32 (hexadecimal `20') followed by `1'.  According to ISO, the closing
\verb$\$ is obligatory and the number of digits is unlimited.  The
SWI-Prolog definition allows for ISO compatible specification, but
is compatible with other implementations.
    \escapeitem{40}
Octal character specification.  The rules and remarks for hexadecimal
specifications apply to octal specifications too, but the maximum
allowed number of octal digits is 3.
    \escapeitem{<character>}
Any character immediately preceded by a \chr{\} is copied verbatim.
Thus, \verb$'\\'$ is an atom consisting of a single \chr{\} and
\verb$'\''$ and \verb$''''$ both describe the atom with a
single~\verb$'$.
\end{description}

Character escaping is only available if the
\exam{feature(character_escapes, true)} is active (default). See
feature/2. Character escapes conflict with writef/2 in two ways:
\verb$\40$ is interpreted as decimal 40 by writef/2, but character
escapes handling by read has already interpreted as 32 (40 octal). Also,
\fmtseq{\l} is translated to a single `l'. Double the \chr{\}
(e.g.\ \fmtseq{\\}, use the above escape sequences or use format/2.

\subsubsection{Syntax for Non-Decimal Numbers}

SWI-Prolog implements both Edinburgh and ISO representations for
non-decimal numbers. According to Edinburgh syntax, such numbers are
written as \exam{<radix>'<number>}, where <radix> is a number between 2
and 36. ISO defines binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers using
\exam{0{\em [bxo]}<number>}. For example: \verb$A is 0b100 \/ 0xf00$ is
a valid expression. Such numbers are always unsigned.


\section{System Limits}

\subsection{Limits on Memory Areas}

SWI-Prolog has a number of memory areas which are not enlarged at run
time, unless you have a version with dynamic stack allocation.  The
default sizes for these areas should suffice for small applications, but
most serious application require larger ones.  They all can be modified
by command line options.  The table below shows these areas.  The first
column gives the option name to modify the size of the area.  This
option character should be followed immediately by a number and
expresses the number of kilo bytes to use for the area.  There are no
other limits than the available memory of the machine to the sizes of
the areas.  The areas are described in \tabref{areas}.

The heap is a memory area to store atoms, clauses, records, flags, etc.
This area is dynamically enlarged at runtime on all versions of SWI-Prolog.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|p{5cm}|}
\hline
Option & Default & Area name & Description \\
\hline
\cmdlineoption{-L} & 2M & \bf local stack & The local stack is used to store
                       the execution environments of procedure
                       invocations. The space for an environment is
                       reclaimed when it fails, exits without leaving
                       choice points, the alternatives are cut of with
                       the !/0 predicate or no choice points have
                       been created since the invocation and the last
                       subclause is started (tail recursion optimisation). \\
\cmdlineoption{-G} & 4M & \bf global stack & The global stack is used
                       to store terms created during Prolog's
                       execution. Terms on this stack will be reclaimed
                       by backtracking to a point before the term
                       was created or by garbage collection (provided the
                       term is no longer referenced). \\
\cmdlineoption{-T} & 4M & \bf trail stack & The trail stack is used to store
                       assignments during execution.  Entries on this
                       stack remain alive until backtracking before the
                       point of creation or the garbage collector 
                       determines they are nor needed any longer. \\
\cmdlineoption{-A} & 1M & \bf argument stack & The argument stack is used to
                       store one of the intermediate code interpreter's 
                       registers. The amount of space needed on this
                       stack is determined entirely by the depth in
                       which terms are nested in the clauses that
                       constitute the program. Overflow is most likely
                       when using long strings in a clause. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
    \caption{Memory areas}
    \label{tab:areas}
\end{table}

\subsection{Other Limits}

\begin{description}
    \item[Clauses]
Currently the following limitations apply to clauses.  The arity may
not be more than 1024 and the number of variables should be less than
65536.
    \item[Atoms and Strings]
SWI-Prolog has no limits on the sizes of atoms and strings.  read/1 and
its derivatives however normally limit the number of newlines in an atom
or string to 5 to improve error detection and recovery.  This can be
switched off with style_check/1.
    \item[Address space]
SWI-Prolog data is packed in a 32-bit word, which contains both type
and value information.  The size of the various memory areas is limited
to 128 Mb for each of the areas.  With some redesign, the program area
could be split into data that should be within this range and the rest
of the data, virtually unlimiting the program size.
    \item[Integers]
Integers are 32-bit to the user, but integers upto the value of the
{\tt max_tagged_integer} feature are represented more efficiently.
    \item[Floats]
Floating point numbers are represented as native double precision
floats, 64 bit IEEE on most machines.
\end{description}

\subsection{Reserved Names}

The boot compiler (see \cmdlineoption{-b} option) does not support the module
system (yet).  As large parts of the system are written in Prolog itself
we need some way to avoid name clashes with the user's predicates, 
database keys, etc.  Like Edinburgh C-Prolog \cite{CPROLOG:manual} all
predicates, database keys, etc.\ that should be hidden from the user
start with a dollar (\chr{\$}) sign (see style_check/1).

The compiler uses the special functor \const{\$VAR\$/1} while analysing the
clause to compile.  Using this functor in a program causes unpredictable
behaviour of the compiler and resulting program.
