\section{Getting started quickly}	\label{sec:quickstart}

\subsection{Starting SWI-Prolog}	\label{sec:starting}

\subsubsection{Starting SWI-Prolog on Unix} \label{sec:startunix}

By default, SWI-Prolog is installed as `swipl'. The command line
arguments of SWI-Prolog itself and its utility programs are documented
using standard Unix \program{man} pages. SWI-Prolog is normally operated
as an interactive application simply by starting the program:

\begin{code}
$ swipl
Welcome to SWI-Prolog ...
...

1 ?-
\end{code}

After starting Prolog, one normally loads a program into it using
consult/1, which may be abbreviated by putting the name of the program
file between square brackets. The following goal loads the file
\href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/master/demo/likes.pl}{likes.pl}
containing clauses for the predicates \nopredref{likes}{2}:

\begin{code}
?- [likes].
true.

?-
\end{code}

Alternatively, the source file may be given as command line arguments:

\begin{code}
$ swipl likes.pl
Welcome to SWI-Prolog ...
...

1 ?-
\end{code}

\begin{quote}
Both the above assume \file{likes.pl} is in your \jargon{working
directory}. If you use the command line version \program{swipl} the
working directory is the same as the shell from which you started
SWI-Prolog. If you started the GUI version (\program{swipl-win}) this
depends largely on the OS. You can use pwd/0 and cd/0 to find and change
the working directory.  The utility ls/0 lists the contents of the working
directory.

\begin{code}
?- pwd.
% /home/janw/src/swipl-devel/linux/
true.
?- cd('~/tmp').
true.

?- pwd.
% /home/janw/tmp/
true.
\end{code}

The file \file{likes.pl} is also installed in a subdirectory \file{demo}
insides SWI-Prolog's installation directory and may be loaded regardless
of the working directory using the command below. See
absolute_file_name/3 and file_search_path/2 for details on how
SWI-Prolog specifies file locations.

\begin{code}
?- [swi(demo/likes)].
true.
\end{code}
\end{quote}

After this point, Unix and Windows users unite, so if you are using
Unix please continue at \secref{consultuser}.

\subsubsection{Starting SWI-Prolog on Windows}
\label{sec:startwin}

After SWI-Prolog has been installed on a Windows system, the following
important new things are available to the user:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A folder (called \jargon{directory} in the remainder of this
	  document) called \file{swipl} containing the executables,
	  libraries, etc., of the system.  No files are installed
	  outside this directory.
    \item A program \program{swipl-win.exe}, providing a window for interaction
          with Prolog. The program \program{swipl.exe} is a version of
	  SWI-Prolog that runs in a console window.
    \item The file extension \fileext{pl} is associated with the program
          \program{swipl-win.exe}.  Opening a \fileext{pl} file will cause
	  \program{swipl-win.exe} to start, change directory to the
	  directory in which the file to open resides, and load this
	  file.
\end{itemize}

The normal way to start the \file{likes.pl} file mentioned in
\secref{startunix} is by simply double-clicking this file in the Windows
explorer.

\subsection{Adding rules from the console}	\label{sec:consultuser}

Although we strongly advice to put your program in a file, optionally
edit it and use make/0 to reload it (see \secref{viewprogram}), it is
possible to manage facts and rules from the terminal. The most
convenient way to add a few clauses is by consulting the pseudo file
\const{user}. The input is ended using the system end-of-file character.

\begin{code}
?- [user].
|: hello :- format('Hello world~n').
|: ^D
true.

?- hello.
Hello world
true.
\end{code}

The predicates assertz/1 and retract/1 are alternatives to add and
remove rules and facts.


\subsection{Executing a query}			\label{sec:execquery}

After loading a program, one can ask Prolog queries about the program.
The query below asks Prolog what food `sam' likes. The system responds
with \mbox{\tt X = <value>} if it can prove the goal for a certain
\arg{X}. The user can type the semi-colon (;) or spacebar%
	\footnote{On most installations, single-character commands are
		  executed without waiting for the {\sc return} key.}
if (s)he wants another solution. Use the \textsc{return} key if you do
not want to see more answers. Prolog completes the output with a full
stop (.) if the user uses the \textsc{return} key or Prolog
\emph{knows} there are no more answers. If Prolog cannot find (more)
answers, it writes \textbf{false.} Finally, Prolog answers using an
error message to indicate the query or program contains an error.

\begin{code}
?- likes(sam, X).
X = dahl ;
X = tandoori ;
...
X = chips.

?-
\end{code}

Note that the answer written by Prolog is a valid Prolog program that,
when executed, produces the same set of answers as the original
program.\footnote{The SWI-Prolog top level differs in several ways from
traditional Prolog top level. The current top level was designed in
cooperation with Ulrich Neumerkel.}


\subsection{Examining and modifying your program} \label{sec:viewprogram}

If properly configured, the predicate edit/1 starts the built-in or
user configured editor on the argument.  The argument can be anything
that can be linked to a location: a file name, predicate name, module
name, etc.  If the argument resolves to only one location the editor
is started on this location, otherwise the user is presented a choice.

If a graphical user interface is available, the editor normally creates
a new window and the system prompts for the next command. The user may
edit the source file, save it and run make/0 to update any modified
source file. If the editor cannot be opened in a window, it opens in
the same console and leaving the editor runs make/0 to reload any
source files that have been modified.

\begin{code}
?- edit(likes).

true.
?- make.
% /home/jan/src/pl-devel/linux/likes compiled 0.00 sec, 0 clauses

?- likes(sam, X).
...
\end{code}

The program can also be \jargon{decompiled} using listing/1 as below.
The argument of listing/1 is just a predicate name, a predicate
\jargon{indicator} of the form \arg{Name/Arity}, e.g., \exam{?-
listing(mild/1).} or a \jargon{head}, e.g., \exam{?- listing(likes(sam,
_)).}, listing all \jargon{matching} clauses. The predicate listing/0,
i.e., without arguments lists the entire program.\footnote{This lists
several \jargon{hook} predicates that are defined by default and is
typically not very informative.}

\begin{code}
?- listing(mild).
mild(dahl).
mild(tandoori).
mild(kurma).

true.
\end{code}


\subsection{Stopping Prolog}			\label{sec:halt}

The interactive toplevel can be stopped in two ways: enter the system
end-of-file character (typically \textit{Control-D}) or by executing the
halt/0 predicate:

\begin{code}
?- halt.
$
\end{code}


\section{The user's initialisation file}	\label{sec:initfile}

\index{startup file}%
\index{user profile file}%
\index{profile file}%
After the system initialisation, the system consults (see consult/1) the
user's \jargon{init} file. This file is searched using
absolute_file_name/3 using the path alias (see file_search_path/2)
\const{app_config}.  This is a directory named \file{swi-prolog} below
the OS default name for placing application configuration data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item On Windows, the CSIDL folder \const{CSIDL_APPDATA}, typically
\verb$C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data$.
    \item If the environment variable \env{XDG_DATA_HOME} is set,
use this. This follows the \href{https://standards.freedesktop.org}{free
desktop} standard.
    \item The expansion of \file{~/.config}.
\end{itemize}

The directory can be found using this call:

\begin{code}
?- absolute_file_name(app_config(.), Dir, [file_type(directory)]).
Dir = '/home/jan/.config/swi-prolog'.
\end{code}

After the first startup file is found it is loaded and Prolog
stops looking for further startup files. The name of the
startup file can be changed with the `\argoption{-f}{file}'
option.  If \arg{File} denotes an absolute path, this file is loaded,
otherwise the file is searched for using the same conventions as for
the default startup file. Finally, if \arg{file} is
\const{none}, no file is loaded.

The installation provides a file \file{customize/init.pl} with
(commented) commands that are often used to customize the behaviour of
Prolog, such as interfacing to the editor, color selection or history
parameters. Many of the development tools provide menu entries for
editing the startup file and starting a fresh startup file from the
system skeleton.

See also the \cmdlineoption{-s} (script) and \cmdlineoption{-F}
(system-wide initialisation) in \secref{cmdline} and \secref{initgoal}.


\section{Initialisation files and goals}		\label{sec:initgoal}

Using command line arguments (see \secref{cmdline}), SWI-Prolog can be
forced to load files and execute queries for initialisation purposes or
non-interactive operation. The most commonly used options are
\argoption{-f}{file} or \argoption{-s}{file} to make Prolog load a file,
\argoption{-g}{goal} to define initialisation goals and
\argoption{-t}{goal} to define the \jargon{top-level goal}. The following
is a typical example for starting an application directly from the
command line.

\begin{code}
machine% swipl -s load.pl -g go -t halt
\end{code}

It tells SWI-Prolog to load \file{load.pl}, start the application using
the \jargon{entry point} \nopredref{go}{0} and ---instead of entering
the interactive top level--- exit after completing \nopredref{go}{0}.

The command line may have multiple \argoption{-g}{goal} occurrences. The
goals are executed in order. Possible choice points of individual goals
are pruned. If a \arg{goal} fails execution stops with exit status
\const{1}. If a \arg{goal} raises an exception, the exception is printed
and the process stops with exit code \const{2}.

The \cmdlineoption{-q} may be used to suppress all informational
messages as well as the error message that is normally printed if an
initialisation goal \emph{fails}.

In MS-Windows, the same can be achieved using a short-cut with
appropriately defined command line arguments. A typically seen
alternative is to write a file \file{run.pl} with content as illustrated
below. Double-clicking \file{run.pl} will start the application.

\begin{code}
:- [load].			% load program
:- go.				% run it
:- halt.			% and exit
\end{code}

\Secref{plscript} discusses further scripting options, and
\chapref{runtime} discusses the generation of runtime executables.
Runtime executables are a means to deliver executables that do not
require the Prolog system.


\section{Command line options}			\label{sec:cmdline}

SWI-Prolog can be executed in one of the following modes:

\begin{description}
    \definition{\exam{swipl --help}}
    \nodescription
    \definition{\exam{swipl --version}}
    \nodescription
    \definition{\exam{swipl --arch}}
    \nodescription
    \definition{\exam{swipl --dump-runtime-variables}}
These options must appear as only option. They cause Prolog to print
an informational message and exit.  See \secref{info-options}.

    \definition{\exam{swipl} [\arg{option} ...]
		\arg{script-file} [\arg{arg} ...]}
These arguments are passed on Unix systems if file that starts
with \mbox{\texttt{\#!/path/to/executable} [\arg{option} ...]} is
executed. Arguments after the script file are made available in the
Prolog flag \prologflag{argv}.

    \definition{\exam{swipl} [\arg{option} ...]
		\arg{prolog-file} ...
		[[\const{--}] \arg{arg} ...]}
This is the normal way to start Prolog. The options are described in
\secref{cli-options}, \secref{stacksizes} and \secref{runoptions}.
The Prolog flag \prologflag{argv} provides access to \arg{arg} ... If
the \arg{options} are followed by one or more Prolog file names (i.e.,
names with extension \fileext{pl}, \fileext{prolog} or (on Windows) the
user preferred extension registered during installation), these files
are loaded. The first file is registered in the Prolog flag
\prologflag{associated_file}. In addition, \program{pl-win[.exe]}
switches to the directory in which this primary source file is located
using working_directory/2.

    \definition{\exam{swipl} -o \arg{output} -c \arg{prolog-file} ...}
The \cmdlineoption{-c} option is used to compile a set of Prolog
files into an executable.  See \secref{compoptions}.

    \definition{\exam{swipl} -o \arg{output} -b \arg{bootfile}
		\arg{prolog-file} ...}
Bootstrap compilation.  See \secref{maintoptions}.
    \end{description}

\subsection{Informational command line options}
\label{sec:info-options}

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{--arch}{}
When given as the only option, it prints the architecture identifier
(see Prolog flag \prologflag{arch}) and exits. See also
\cmdlineoption{--dump-runtime-variables}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--dump-runtime-variables}{[=format]}
When given as the only option, it prints a sequence of variable settings
that can be used in shell scripts to deal with Prolog parameters.  This
feature is also used by \program{swipl-ld} (see \secref{plld}).  Below is
a typical example of using this feature.

\begin{code}
eval `swipl --dump-runtime-variables`
cc -I$PLBASE/include -L$PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH ...
\end{code}

The option can be followed by \const{=sh} to dump in POSIX shell format
(default) or \const{=cmd} to dump in MS-Windows \program{cmd.exe}
compatible format.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--help}{}
When given as the only option, it summarises the most important options.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--version}{}
When given as the only option, it summarises the version and the
architecture identifier.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--abi-version}{}
Print a key (string) that represents the binary compatibility on
a number of aspects.  See \secref{abi-versions}.
\end{description}


\subsection{Command line options for running Prolog}
\label{sec:cli-options}

Note that \jargon{boolean options} may be written as \exam{--name}
(true), \exam{--noname} or \exam{--no-name} (false).  They are written
as \exam{--no-name} below as the default is `true'.

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-D}{name[=value]}
Set the Prolog flag \arg{name} to \arg{value}. The flags are set
immediately after loading the initial \jargon{saved state}. If the flag
is already defined, \arg{value} is converted to the type of the flag. If
the flag is undefined it is set to a number of \arg{value} represents a
number and an atom otherwise. If no \const{=}\arg{value} is given, a
Boolean value is used. If \arg{name} is \const{no-}\arg{flag},
\arg{flag} is set to \const{false}. Otherwise, the flag \arg{name} is
set to \const{true}. The \exam{name[=value]} may follow the \exam{-D}
immediately or appear as the next commandline argument.

Note that many of the commandline options are reflected by a Prolog
flag. We intend to handle these as synonyms. Currently, some of the
commandline flags affect the Prolog initilization before loading the
saved state has completed, while other may not be changed after Prolog
initialization. For example, future versions will support
\exam{-Dhome=dir} to change the notion of the Prolog installation
directory.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--debug-on-interrupt}{}
Enable debugging on an interrupt signal (Control-C, \const{SIGINT})
immediately.  Normally debugging on interrupt is enabled when entering
the interactive toplevel.  This flag can be used to start the debugger
on an interrupt while executing goals from \cmdlineoption{-g} or
initialization/[1,2].  See also the Prolog flag
\prologflag{debug_on_interrupt}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--home[=DIR]}{}
Use \arg{DIR} as home directory.  See \secref{findhome} for details.
If \arg{DIR} is omitted, the found location is printed and the process
exits.  If the location cannot be found an error is printed and the
process exits with status 1.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--quiet}{}
\index{verbose}\index{quiet}%
Set the Prolog flag \prologflag{verbose} to \const{silent}, suppressing
informational and banner messages.  Also available as \cmdlineoption{-q}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--no-debug}{}
Disable debugging.  See the current_prolog_flag/2 flag
\prologflag{generate_debug_info} for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--no-signals}{}
Inhibit any signal handling by Prolog, a property that is sometimes
desirable for embedded applications. This option sets the flag
\prologflag{signals} to \const{false}. See \secref{sigembedded} for
details.  Note that the handler to unblock system calls is still
installed. This can be prevented using \exam{--sigalert=0} additionally.
See \cmdlineoption{--sigalert}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--no-threads}{}
Disable threading for the multi-threaded version at runtime.  See also
the flags \prologflag{threads} and \prologflag{gc_thread}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--no-packs}{}
Do \emph{not} attach extension packages (add-ons). See also
attach_packs/0 and the Prolog flag \prologflag{packs}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--no-pce}{}
Enable/disable the xpce GUI subsystem. The default is to make it
available as autoload component if it is installed and the system
can access the graphics.  Using \exam{--pce} load the xpce system
in user space and \exam{--no-pce} makes it unavailable in the session.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--on-error}{=style}
How to handle on errors.  See the Prolog flag \prologflag{on_error}
for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--on-warning}{=style}
How to handle on warnings. See the Prolog flag \prologflag{on_warning}
for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--pldoc}{[=port]}
Start the PlDoc documentation system on a free network port and launch
the user's browser on \verb$http://localhost:$\arg{port}. If
\arg{port} is specified, the server is started at the given port and the
browser is \emph{not} launched.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--sigalert=NUM}{}
Use signal \arg{NUM} (1\ldots{}31) for alerting a thread. This is needed
to make thread_signal/2, and derived Prolog signal handling act
immediately when the target thread is blocked on an interruptible
system call (e.g., sleep/1, read/write to most devices).  The default is
to use \const{SIGUSR2}.  If \arg{NUM} is 0 (zero), this handler is not
installed.  See prolog_alert_signal/2 to query or modify this value at
runtime.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--no-tty}{}
Unix only.  Switches controlling the terminal for allowing
single-character commands to the tracer and get_single_char/1. By
default, manipulating the terminal is enabled unless the system detects
it is not connected to a terminal or it is running as a GNU-Emacs
inferior process.  See also \prologflag{tty_control}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--win-app}{}
This option is available only in \program{swipl-win.exe} and is used for the
start-menu item. If causes \program{plwin} to start in the folder
\verb$...\My Documents\Prolog$ or local equivalent thereof (see
win_folder/2).  The \file{Prolog} subdirectory is created if it
does not exist.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-O}{}
Optimised compilation. See current_prolog_flag/2 flag
\prologflag{optimise} for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-l}{file}
Load \arg{file}. This flag provides compatibility with some other Prolog
systems.\footnote{YAP, SICStus} It is used in SWI-Prolog to skip the
program initialization specified using initialization/2 directives. See
also \secref{plscript}, and initialize/0.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-s}{file}
Use \arg{file} as a script file.  The script file is loaded after
the initialisation file specified with the \argoption{-f}{file}
option.  Unlike \argoption{-f}{file}, using \cmdlineoption{-s}
does not stop Prolog from loading the personal initialisation file.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-f}{file}
Use \arg{file} as initialisation file instead of the default
\file{init.pl}. `\argoption{-f}{none}' stops SWI-Prolog from searching
for a startup file. This option can be used as an alternative to
\argoption{-s}{file} that stops Prolog from loading the personal
initialisation file. See also \secref{initfile}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-F}{script}
Select a startup script from the SWI-Prolog home directory. The
script file is named \file{<script>.rc}. The default
\arg{script} name is deduced from the executable, taking the leading
alphanumerical characters (letters, digits and underscore) from the
program name. \argoption{-F}{none} stops looking for a script. Intended
for simple management of slightly different versions. One could, for
example, write a script \file{iso.rc} and then select ISO compatibility
mode using \exam{pl -F iso} or make a link from \program{iso-pl} to
\program{pl}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-x}{bootfile}
Boot from \arg{bootfile} instead of the system's default boot file. A
boot file is a file resulting from a Prolog compilation using the
\cmdlineoption{-b} or \cmdlineoption{-c} option or a program saved using
qsave_program/[1,2].

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-p}{alias=path1[:path2 \ldots]}
Define a path alias for file_search_path. \arg{alias} is the name of
the alias, and arg{path1 ...} is a list of values for the alias. On Windows
the list separator is \chr{;}. On other systems it is \chr{:}. A value
is either a term of the form \mbox{alias(value)} or pathname. The
computed aliases are added to file_search_path/2 using asserta/1, so
they precede predefined values for the alias. See file_search_path/2 for
details on using this file location mechanism.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--traditional}{}
This flag disables the most important extensions of SWI-Prolog
version~7 (see \secref{extensions}) that introduce incompatibilities
with earlier versions.  In particular, lists are represented in the
traditional way, double quoted text is represented by a list of
character codes and the functional notation on dicts is not supported.
Dicts as a syntactic entity, and the predicates that act on them, are
still supported if this flag is present.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--}{}
\index{command line, arguments}%
Stops scanning for more arguments, so you can pass arguments for your
application after this one.  See current_prolog_flag/2 using the
flag \prologflag{argv} for obtaining the command line arguments.
\end{description}

\subsection{Controlling the stack sizes}
\label{sec:stacksizes}

As of version 7.7.14 the stacks are no longer limited individually.
Instead, only the combined size is limited. Note that 32~bit systems
still pose a 128Mb limit. See \secref{memlimit}. The combined limit is
by default 1Gb on 64~bit machines and 512Mb on 32~bit machines.

For example, to limit the stacks to 32Gb use the command below. Note
that the stack limits apply \emph{per thread}. Individual threads may be
controlled using the \term{stack_limit}{+Bytes} option of thread_create.
Any thread can call \term{set_prolog_flag}{stack_limit, Limit} (see
\prologflag{stack_limit}) to adjust the stack limit. This limit is
inherited by threads created from this thread.

\begin{code}
$ swipl --stack-limit=32g
\end{code}

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem*{--stack-limit}{=size[bkmg]}
Limit the combined size of the Prolog stacks to the indicated \arg{size}.
The suffix specifies the value as \textit{bytes}, \textit{Kbytes},
\textit{Mbytes} or \textit{Gbytes}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{--table-space}{=size[bkmg]}
Limit for the \arg{table space}. This is where tries holding
memoized\footnote{The letter M is used because the T was already in
use. It is a mnemonic for \textbf{M}emoizing.} answers for
\jargon{tabling} are stored. The default is 1Gb on 64~bit machines and
512Mb on 32~bit machines. See the Prolog flag
\prologflag{table_space}.
    \cmdlineoptionitem*{--shared-table-space}{=size[bkmg]}
Limit for the table space for \jargon{shared} tables. See
\secref{tabling-shared}.
\end{description}


\subsection{Running goals from the command line}
\label{sec:runoptions}

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-g}{goal}
\arg{Goal} is executed just before entering the top level. This option
may appear multiple times. See \secref{initgoal} for details. If no
initialization goal is present the system calls version/0 to print the
welcome message. The welcome message can be suppressed with
\cmdlineoption{--quiet}, but also with \argoption{-g}{true}. \arg{goal}
can be a complex term. In this case quotes are normally needed to
protect it from being expanded by the shell. A safe way to run a goal
non-interactively is below. If \nopredref{go}{0} succeeds
\argoption{-g}{halt} causes the process to stop with exit code 0. If it
fails, the exit code is 1; and if it raises an exception, the exit code
is 2.

\begin{code}
% swipl <options> -g go -g halt
\end{code}

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-t}{goal}
Use \arg{goal} as interactive top level instead of the default goal
prolog/0. The \arg{goal} can be a complex term. If the top-level goal
succeeds SWI-Prolog exits with status 0. If it fails the exit status is
1. If the top level raises an exception, this is printed as an uncaught
error and the top level is \emph{restarted}. This flag also determines
the goal started by break/0 and abort/0. If you want to prevent the user
from entering interactive mode, start the application with
`\argoption{-g}{goal} \argoption{-t}{halt}'.
\end{description}


\subsection{Compilation options}
\label{sec:compoptions}

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-c}{file \ldots}
Compile files into an `intermediate code file'. See \secref{compilation}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-o}{output}
Used in combination with \cmdlineoption{-c} or \cmdlineoption{-b} to
determine output file for compilation.
\end{description}

\subsection{Maintenance options}
\label{sec:maintoptions}

The following options are for system maintenance. They are given
for reference only.

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-b}{initfile \ldots \cmdlineoption{-c} file \ldots}
Boot compilation.  \arg{initfile \ldots} are compiled by the C-written
bootstrap compiler, \arg{file \ldots} by the normal Prolog compiler.
System maintenance only.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-d}{token1,token2,...}
Print debug messages for DEBUG statements tagged with one of the
indicated tokens. Only has effect if the system is compiled with the
\const{-DO_DEBUG} flag. System maintenance only.
\end{description}


\section{UI Themes}				\label{sec:theme}

UI (colour) themes play a role in two parts: when writing to the
\jargon{console} and for the xpce-based development tools such as
PceEmacs or the graphical debugger. Coloured console output is based on
ansi_format/3. The central message infra structure based on
print_message/2 labels message (components) with a Prolog term that
specifies the role. This is mapped to concrete colours by means of the
hook prolog:console_color/2. Theming the IDE uses xpce \jargon{class
variables} that are initialised from Prolog when xpce is loaded.

Themes are implemented as a Prolog file in the file search path
library/theme.  A theme can be loaded using (for example) the directive
below in the user's initialization file (see \secref{initfile}).

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(theme/dark)).
\end{code}

The theme file \exam{library(theme/auto)} is provided to automatically
choose a reasonable theme based on the environment.  The current version
detects the background color on \textit{xterm} compatible terminal
emulators (found on most Unix systems) and loads the \const{dark} theme
if the background is `darkish'.

The following notes apply to the different platforms on which SWI-Prolog
is supported:

\begin{description}
    \item[Unix/Linux]
If an xterm compatible terminal emulator is used to run Prolog you may
wish to load either an explicit theme or \exam{library(theme/auto)}.

    \item[Epilog Prolog consoles]
The \program{swipl-win} graphical application can be themed by
loading a theme file.  The theme file also sets the foreground and
background colours for the Epilog console.
\end{description}


\subsection{Status of theme support}		\label{sec:theme-status}

Theme support was added in SWI-Prolog 8.1.11. Only part of the IDE tools
are covered and the only additional theme (\const{dark}) is not net well
balanced. The interfaces between the theme file and notably the IDE
components is not very well established.  Please contribute by improving
the \const{dark} theme. Once that is complete and properly functioning
we can start adding new themes.


\section{GNU Emacs Interface}			\label{sec:gemacs}

\index{GNU-Emacs}\index{Emacs}

SWI-Prolog provides tight integration with GNU~Emacs through the
\const{sweep} package.  This package embeds SWI-Prolog as a dynamic
Emacs module, allowing for Prolog queries to be executed directly from
Emacs Lisp.  The accompanying Emacs package \const{sweeprolog.el},
available for installation with the standard Emacs package manager
\const{package.el}, builds on top of this embedding to provide a fully
integrated development environment for SWI-Prolog in GNU~Emacs.

GNU~Emacs ships with by default with a Prolog mode called
\const{prolog.el}.  Compared to \const{sweeprolog.el}, this mode
suffers from some problems that arise due to the lack of a proper
Prolog parser.  The original \const{prolog.el} by Masanobu Umeda has
been included in GNU Emacs since 1989, in 2006 Stefan Monnier added
explicit support for SWI-Prolog to \const{prolog.el}.  In 2011, most
of the original implementation has been replaced with a new Prolog
mode written by initially for the XEmacs port by Stefan Bruda.
Bruda's mode was adapted to GNU~Emacs by Stefan Monnier, who has been
maintaining it along with other GNU~Emacs contributor since.  Users of
this mode may find useful configuration suggestions at
\url{https://www.metalevel.at/pceprolog/}.

\section{Command line history}			\label{sec:history}

SWI-Prolog offers a query substitution mechanism similar to what is seen
in Unix shells. The availability of this feature is controlled by
set_prolog_flag/2, using the \prologflag{history} Prolog flag. By
default, history is available if no interactive command line editor is
available. To enable history, remembering the last 50 commands, put the
following into your startup file (see \secref{initfile}):

\begin{code}
:- set_prolog_flag(history, 50).
\end{code}

The history system allows the user to compose new queries from those
typed before and remembered by the system. The available history
commands are shown in \tabref{history}. History expansion is not done if
these sequences appear in quoted atoms or strings.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\verb+!!.+            & Repeat last query \\
\verb+!nr.+           & Repeat query numbered <nr> \\
\verb+!str.+          & Repeat last query starting with <str> \\
\verb+h.+             & Show history of commands \\
\verb+!h.+            & Show this list \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
    \caption{History commands}
    \label{tab:history}
\end{table}


\section{Reuse of top-level bindings}    \label{sec:topvars}

Bindings resulting from the successful execution of a top-level goal are
asserted in a database \emph{if they are not too large} (as defined by
the Prolog flag \prologflag{toplevel_var_size}). These values may be
reused in further top-level queries as \$Var. If the same variable name
is used in a subsequent query the system associates the variable with
the latest binding. Example:

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
1 ?- maplist(plus(1), `hello`, X).
X = [105,102,109,109,112].

2 ?- format('~s~n', [$X]).
ifmmp
true.

3 ?-
\end{code}
    \caption{Reusing top-level bindings}
    \label{fig:topevelvars}

Note that variables may be set by executing \predref{=}{2}:

\begin{code}
6 ?- X = statistics.
X = statistics.

7 ?- $X.

\section{Overview of the Debugger}		\label{sec:debugoverview}

\input{textdebugger.tex}

\section{Loading and running projects}		\label{sec:compilation}

Most Prolog programs are split over multiple files organized in a
directory and optionally multiple subdirectories.  Typically all files
are Prolog \jargon{module} files.  See \secref{modules}.  Typically,
the directory contains a file, often called \file{load.pl}, that loads
all other files (modules) using use_module/[1,2] or, for projects that
do not use modules, using ensure_loaded/1.

If the project is an application (rather than a library), there are
several ways to start it.  One option is by using the commandline
option \cmdlineoption{-g} \arg{goal}.  The classical Prolog way is by
using an initialization/1 \jargon{directive}.  Th problem with the
latter is that such directives are both used for runtime
initialization in modules and starting the application while it is
hard to control the order in which they are executed.  For this
reason, SWI-Prolog introduced initialization/2, adding an argument
that specifies the role and (indirectly) the order of initialization.
The application entry point is now declared using

\begin{code}
:- initialization(start, main).

start :-
    ...
\end{code}

Using these conventions we may run the application using this command line,
where \arg{option ...} are Prolog options to control e.g., memory limits.
Typically, none are required.  \arg{arg ...} are made available to the
program using the Prolog flag \prologflag{argv}.

\begin{code}
% swipl [option ...] load.pl [arg ...]
\end{code}

To merely load the code without running the application, provided the
entry point is started using the initialization/2 directive described
above, we can use the \cmdlineoption{-l}.  After loading we can debug
and/or edit the application.

\begin{code}
% swipl [option ...] -l load.pl [arg ...]
\end{code}

Rather than just using \nopredref{start}{0} as above, applications
typically use main/0 from the library \pllib{main}.  The main/0
predicate prepares for non-development usage and calls main/1 with the
application \arg{argv} (command line arguments).  These are normally
processed into \jargon{positional arguments} and \jargon{options}
using argv_options/2 from the same library.

While the above works fine when using Prolog from the commandline,
it is less suitable for scenarios that make it hard to control the
SWI-Prolog commandline which as using \program{swipl-win} or running
Prolog under some IDE such as Emacs.  Loading a program that uses
the above initialization/2 directive into the toplevel using

\begin{code}
?- [load].
\end{code}

does \textbf{not} start the entry point.  Opening a \fileext{.pl}
file using \program{swipl-win} does start the entry point.


\subsection{Running an application}	\label{sec:runcomp}

There are various options if you want to make your program ready
for real usage.  The best choice depends on whether the program
is to be used only on machines holding the SWI-Prolog development
system, the size of the program, and the operating system (Unix
vs.\ Windows).   There are four options

\begin{itemize}
\item On Unix-like systems one can use the \jargon{shebang} magic
  sequence to turn a Prolog source into an executable.  See
  \secref{plscript}.
\item On any system you can use a \jargon{shell script} (Unix
  \program{sh} or Windows \program{cmd}) script to start the
  application.  See \secref{shellscript}.
\item On any system you can create a \jargon{saved state} that
  consists of the virtual machine code and a startup sequence.  Saved
  states can be stand-alone and with some precautions they can work
  without SWI-Prolog itself installed.  They start fast, but they are
  big and creating a state from a program that uses native code
  extensions and (file) resources is not trivial while details depend
  on the OS and required resources.  See \secref{makestate}.
\item On any system you can add a Prolog file to a designated
  directory and allow it to be started using
\begin{code}
swipl name [arg ...]
\end{code}
  New commands can be added to the Prolog installation, by Prolog
  \jargon{packs}, in a user specific directory or in a system-wide
  directory.  See \secref{swipl-app}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Using PrologScript}	\label{sec:plscript}

A Prolog source file can be used directly as a Unix program using the
Unix \verb$#!$ magic start. The Unix \verb$#!$ magic is allowed because
if the first letter of a Prolog file is \verb$#$, the first line is
treated as a comment.\footnote{The \texttt{\#}-sign can be the legal
start of a normal Prolog clause. In the unlikely case this is required,
leave the first line blank or add a header comment.} To create a Prolog
script, use one of the two alternatives below as first line. The first
can be used to bind a script to a specific Prolog installation, while
the latter uses the default prolog installed in \verb"$PATH".

\begin{code}
#!/path/to/swipl
#!/usr/bin/env swipl
\end{code}

The interpretation of arguments to the executable in the
\jargon{HashBang} line differs between Unix-derived systems. For
portability, the \verb$#!$ must be followed immediately with an absolute
path to the executable and should have none or one argument. Neither the
executable path, nor the argument shall use quotes or spaces. When
started this way, the Prolog flag \prologflag{argv} contains the command
line arguments that follow the script invocation.

Starting with version 7.5.8, initialization/2 support the \arg{When}
options \const{program} and \const{main}, allowing for the following
definition of a Prolog script that evaluates an arithmetic expression on
the command line. Note that main/0 is defined lib the library
\pllib{main}. It calls main/1 with the command line arguments after
disabling signal handling.

\begin{code}
#!/usr/bin/env swipl

:- initialization(main, main).

main(Argv) :-
    atomic_list_concat(Argv, ' ', SingleArg),
    term_to_atom(Term, SingleArg),
    Val is Term,
    format('~w~n', [Val]).
\end{code}

And here are two example runs:

\begin{code}
% ./eval 1+2
3
% ./eval foo
ERROR: is/2: Arithmetic: `foo/0' is not a function
\end{code}

Prolog script may be launched for debugging or inspection purposes using
the \cmdlineoption{-l} or \cmdlineoption{-t}. For example,
\cmdlineoption{-l} merely loads the script, ignoring \const{main} and
\const{program} initialization.

\begin{code}
swipl -l eval 1+1
<banner>

?- main.
2
true.

?-
\end{code}

We can also force the program to enter the interactive toplevel after
the application is completed using \exam{-t prolog}:

\begin{code}
swipl -t prolog eval 1+1
2
?-
\end{code}

The Windows version simply ignores the \verb$#!$ line.\footnote{Older
versions extracted command line arguments from the \jargon{HashBang}
line.  As of version 5.9 all relevant setup can be achieved using
\jargon{directives}.  Due to the compatibility issues around
\jargon{HashBang} line processing, we decided to remove it completely.}


\subsubsection{Creating a shell script}		\label{sec:shellscript}

With the introduction of \jargon{PrologScript} (see \secref{plscript}),
using shell scripts as explained in this section has become redundant
for most applications.

Especially on Unix systems and not-too-large applications, writing
a shell script that simply loads your application and calls the
entry point is often a good choice.  A skeleton for the script is
given below, followed by the Prolog code to obtain the program
arguments.  See library \pllib{main} and argv_options/3 for details.

\begin{code}
#!/bin/sh

base=<absolute-path-to-source>
SWIPL=swipl

exec $SWIPL "$base/load.pl" -- "$@"
\end{code}

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(main)).
:- initialization(main,main).

main(Argv) :-
    argv_options(Argv, Positional, Options),
    go(Positional, Options).

go(Positional, Options) :-
    ...
\end{code}

On Windows systems, similar behaviour can be achieved by creating a
shortcut to Prolog, passing the proper options or writing a \fileext{bat}
file.


\subsubsection{Creating a saved state}		\label{sec:makestate}

For larger programs, as well as for programs that are required to run on
systems that do not have the SWI-Prolog development system installed,
creating a saved state is the best solution. A saved state is created
using qsave_program/[1,2] or the \cmdlineoption{-c} command line option.
A saved state is a file containing machine-independent\footnote{The
saved state does not depend on the CPU instruction set or endianness.
Saved states for 32- and 64-bits are not compatible. Typically, saved
states only run on the same version of Prolog on which they have been
created.} intermediate code in a format dedicated for fast loading.
Optionally, the emulator may be integrated in the saved state, creating
a single file, but machine-dependent, executable. This process is
described in \chapref{runtime}.


\subsubsection{Compilation using the -c command line option}
\label{sec:cmdlinecomp}

This mechanism loads a series of Prolog source files and then creates
a saved state as qsave_program/2 does.  The command syntax is:

\begin{code}
% swipl [option ...] [-o output] -c file.pl ...
\end{code}

The \arg{options} argument are options to qsave_program/2 written in
the format below.  The option names and their values are described with
qsave_program/2.

\begin{quote}
\verb$--${\em option-name}\verb$=$\em{option-value}
\end{quote}

For example, to create a stand-alone executable that starts by executing
\nopredref{main}{0} and for which the source is loaded through
\file{load.pl}, use the command

\begin{code}
% swipl --goal=main --stand_alone=true -o myprog -c load.pl
\end{code}

This performs exactly the same as executing

\begin{code}
% swipl
<banner>

?- [load].
?- qsave_program(myprog,
		 [ goal(main),
		   stand_alone(true)
		 ]).
?- halt.
\end{code}

\subsubsection{SWI-Prolog app scripts}	\label{sec:swipl-app}

As of version 9.1.18, SWI-Prolog allows starting an application
using the command below.

\begin{code}
swipl [option ...] [path:]name [arg ...]
\end{code}

This command line first processes Prolog options described in
\secref{cmdline}.  Note that most standard Prolog commandline options
are not relevant.  The \cmdlineoption{-f} defaults to \const{none},
which implies that the user init file is by default not loaded.  If an
application wishes to load the user init file, it should load
\verb$user_app_config(init)$ if this file exists (see
exists_source/1).

Next, it locates \exam{path(name)} using SWI-Prolog's file search
mechanism defined by absolute_file_name/3.  After loading this file it
finds the last goal registered for \const{main} using initialization/2
as described in \secref{compilation} - if there is no initization
directive for \const{main}, the program terminates with an error.  By
default, the application terminates after the entry point terminates.
The entry point may enable the interactive Prolog REPL loop by calling
cli_enable_development_system/0. Other forms of the initialization/2
directive are also allowed, in addition to `main`.

All command line options after \verb$[path:]name$ are accessible in
the Prolog flag \prologflag{argv}.

The optional \arg{path} defaults to \const{app}.  By default, apps are
searched in the directories below.  See file_search_path/2 for
details.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \file{app} directory of the SWI-Prolog installation
\item User and site configuration.  On POSIX systems using the
  XDG file name conventions, this is normally \file{~/.local/share/swi-prolog/app/}
  and \file{/usr/share/swi-prolog/app}.
\item The \file{app} directory of a Prolog \jargon{pack}.
\end{enumerate}

The following apps are provided by the installation

\begin{description}
    \definition{app}
    Print information on installed apps.   For example, to list all
    available apps, run
\begin{code}
swipl app list
\end{code}
    \definition{pack}
    Command line driven management of Prolog packs.  This is a front-end
    to the Prolog library \pllib{prolog_pack}.  For example, to find
    packages related to \textit{type}, use the command below.
\begin{code}
swipl pack find type
\end{code}
\end{description}


\section{Environment Control (Prolog flags)}	\label{sec:flags}

The predicates current_prolog_flag/2 and set_prolog_flag/2 allow the
user to examine and modify the execution environment.  It provides
access to whether optional features are available on this version,
operating system, foreign code environment, command line arguments,
version, as well as runtime flags to control the runtime behaviour
of certain predicates to achieve compatibility with other Prolog
environments.

\begin{description}
    \predicate[ISO]{current_prolog_flag}{2}{?Key, -Value}
The predicate current_prolog_flag/2 defines an interface to installation
features: options compiled in, version, home, etc. With both arguments
unbound, it will generate all defined Prolog flags. With \arg{Key}
instantiated, it unifies \arg{Value} with the value of the Prolog flag
or fails if the \arg{Key} is not a Prolog flag.

Flags marked \jargon{changeable} can be modified by the user using
set_prolog_flag/2. Flag values are typed. Flags marked as \const{bool}
can have the values \const{true} or \const{false}. The predicate
create_prolog_flag/3 may be used to create flags that describe or
control behaviour of libraries and applications.  The library
\pllib{settings} provides an alternative interface for managing
notably application parameters.

Some Prolog flags are not defined in all versions, which is normally
indicated in the documentation below as \textit{``if present and
true''}. A boolean Prolog flag is true iff the Prolog flag is present
{\bf and} the \arg{Value} is the atom \const{true}. Tests for such flags
should be written as below:

\begin{code}
	(   current_prolog_flag(windows, true)
	->  <Do MS-Windows things>
	;   <Do normal things>
	)
\end{code}

Some Prolog flags are scoped to a source file. This implies that if they
are set using a directive inside a file, the flag value encountered when
loading of the file started is restored when loading of the file is
completed. Currently, the following flags are scoped to the source file:
\prologflag{generate_debug_info} and \prologflag{optimise}.

A new thread (see \secref{threads}) \emph{copies} all flags from the
thread that created the new thread (its \jargon{parent}).\footnote{This
is implemented using the copy-on-write technique.} As a consequence,
modifying a flag inside a thread does not affect other threads.


\begin{description}
    \prologflagitem{abi_version}{dict}{r}
The flag value is a dict with keys that describe the version of
the various Application Binary Interface (ABI) components.  See
\secref{abi-versions} for details.

    \prologflagitem{access_level}{atom}{rw}
This flag defines a normal `user' view (\const{user}, default) or a
`system' view. In system view all system code is fully accessible as if
it was normal user code. In user view, certain operations are not
permitted and some details are kept invisible.  We leave the exact
consequences undefined, but, for example, system code can be traced
using system access and system predicates can be redefined.

    \prologflagitem{address_bits}{integer}{r}
Address size of the hosting machine.  Typically 32 or 64.  Except for
the maximum stack limit, this has few implications to the user.  See
also the Prolog flag \prologflag{arch}.

    \prologflagitem{agc_close_streams}{boolean}{rw}
When \const{true} (default \const{false}\footnote{Future versions are
likely to change the default to \const{true}.}), that atom garbage
collector streams that are garbage collected while being open. In
addition, a warning is printed. Below is an example of such a warning.

\begin{code}
WARNING: AGC: closed <stream>(0x560e29014400)
\end{code}

Note that closing I/O streams should not be left to the (atom) garbage
collector because it may take long before the atom garbage collector
runs and because that atom garbage collector is \jargon{conservative},
which implies that it is not guaranteed that all garbage atoms are
reclaimed. Code that uses I/O streams should use setup_call_cleanup/3
using the skeleton below, where \nopredref{process}{1} is a predicate
that reads from or writes to \arg{Stream}.

\begin{code}
    setup_call_cleanup(
	open(..., Stream),
	process(Stream),
	close(Stream)),
    ...
\end{code}

Note that the setting for this flag in the \const{main} thread applies.

    \prologflagitem{agc_margin}{integer}{rw}
If this amount of atoms possible garbage atoms exist perform atom
garbage collection at the first opportunity.  Initial value is 10,000.
May be changed. A value of 0 (zero) disables atom garbage collection.
See also PL_register_atom().\footnote{Given that SWI-Prolog has no
limit on the length of atoms, 10,000 atoms may still occupy a lot of
memory.  Applications using extremely large atoms may wish to call
garbage_collect_atoms/0 explicitly or lower the margin.}

    \prologflagitem{allow_dot_in_atom}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), dots may be embedded into atoms
that are not quoted and start with a letter. The embedded dot
\emph{must} be followed by an identifier continuation character (i.e.,
letter, digit or underscore). The dot is allowed in identifiers in many
languages, which can make this a useful flag for defining DSLs.  Note
that this conflicts with cascading functional notation.  For example,
\exam{Post.meta.author} is read as \exam{.(Post, 'meta.author'} if this
flag is set to \const{true}.

    \prologflagitem{allow_variable_name_as_functor}{bool}{rw}
If true (default is false), \exam{Functor(arg)} is read as if it were
written \exam{'Functor'(arg)}. Some applications use the Prolog read/1
predicate for reading an application-defined script language. In these
cases, it is often difficult to explain to non-Prolog users of the
application that constants and functions can only start with a lowercase
letter. Variables can be turned into atoms starting with an uppercase
atom by calling read_term/2 using the option \const{variable_names} and
binding the variables to their name. Using this feature, F(x) can be
turned into valid syntax for such script languages. Suggested by Robert
van Engelen.  SWI-Prolog specific.

    \prologflagitem{android}{bool}{r}
If present and true, it indicates we are running on the
Android OS. The flag is not present in other operating systems.

    \prologflagitem{android_api}{integer}{r}
If running on Android, it indicates the compile-time API
Level defined by the C macro \verb$__ANDROID_API__$. It is not
defined if running on other operating systems. The API level may
or may not match the API level of the running device, since it is
the API level at compile time.

    \prologflagitem{answer_write_options}{term}{rw}
This flag is used by the interactive toplevel to print the value if
\jargon{bindings} (answers). The flag value is passed to write_term/2
when printing an answer queries. Default is \texttt{[quoted(true),
portray(true), max_depth(10), attributes(portray)]}.

    \prologflagitem{apple}{bool}{r}
\index{MacOS}%
If present and \const{true}, the operating system is MacOSX. Defined if
the C compiler used to compile this version of SWI-Prolog defines
\verb$__APPLE__$.  Note that the \prologflag{unix} is also defined
for MacOSX.

    \prologflagitem{apple_universal_binary}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, SWI-Prolog has been build as a
\jargon{universal binary}.  Universal binaries contain native
executable code for multiple architectures.  Currently the
supported architectures are \const{x86_64} and \const{arm64}.
The archirecture prefix for components is \const{fat-darwin}
while the \prologflag{arch} depends on the actual CPU
type.

    \prologflagitem{arch}{atom}{r}
Identifier for the hardware and operating system SWI-Prolog is running
on. Used to select foreign files for the right architecture. See also
\secref{shlib} and file_search_path/2.  For Apple, see also
\prologflag{apple_universal_binary}.

    \prologflagitem{argv}{list}{rw}
List is a list of atoms representing the application command line
arguments. Application command line arguments are those that have
\emph{not} been processed by Prolog during its initialization. Note that
Prolog's argument processing stops at \const{--} or the first non-option
argument.  See also \prologflag{os_argv}.\footnote{Prior to version
6.5.2, \prologflag{argv} was defined as \prologflag{os_argv} is now.
The change was made for compatibility reasons and because the current
definition is more practical.}

    \prologflagitem{associated_file}{atom}{r}
Set if Prolog was started with a prolog file as argument.  Used by
e.g., edit/0 to edit the initial file.

    \prologflagitem{autoload}{atom}{rw}
This flag controls autoloading predicates based on autoload/1 and
autoload/2 as well as predicates from \jargon{autoload libraries}.
It has the following values:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{false}{}
Predicates are never auto-loaded. If predicates have been imported
before using autoload/[1,2], load the referenced files immediately using
use_module/[1,2]. Note that most of the development utilities such as
listing/1 have to be explicitly imported before they can be used at the
toplevel.

    \termitem{explicit}{}
Do not autoload from \jargon{autoload libraries}, but do use lazy
loading for predicates imported using autoload/[1,2].

    \termitem{user}{}
As \const{false}, but to autoload library predicates into the global
\const{user} module.  This makes the development tools and library
implicitly available to the toplevel, but not to modules.

    \termitem{user_or_explicit}{}
Combines \const{explicit} with \const{user}, providing lazy loading
of predicates imported using autoload/[1,2] and implicit access to the
whole library for the toplevel.

    \termitem{true}{}
Provide full autoloading everywhere.  This is the default.
\end{description}

    \prologflagitem{back_quotes}{codes,chars,string,symbol_char}{rw}
Defines the term-representation for back-quoted material.  The default
is \const{codes}. If \cmdlineoption{--traditional} is given, the default
is \const{symbol_char}, which allows using \verb$`$ in operators
composed of symbols.\footnote{Older versions had a boolean flag
\const{backquoted_strings}, which toggled between \const{string} and
\const{symbol_char}}  See also \secref{string}.

    \prologflagitem{backtrace}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), print a backtrace on an uncaught exception.

    \prologflagitem{backtrace_depth}{integer}{rw}
If backtraces on errors are enabled, this flag defines the maximum
number of frames that is printed (default~20).

    \prologflagitem{backtrace_goal_depth}{integer}{rw}
The frame of a backtrace is printed after making a shallow copy of the
goal.  This flag determines the depth to which the goal term is copied.
Default is `3'.

    \prologflagitem{backtrace_show_lines}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), try to reconstruct the line number at which
the exception happened.

    \prologflagitem{bounded}{bool}{r}
ISO Prolog flag. If \const{true}, integer representation is bound by
\prologflag{min_integer} and \prologflag{max_integer}. If
\const{false} integers can be arbitrarily large and the
\prologflag{min_integer} and \prologflag{max_integer} are not present.
The flag \prologflag{max_integer_size} may be used to enforce an
arbitrary limit rather than exhausting memory. See \secref{artypes}.

    \prologflagitem{break_level}{integer}{r}
Current break-level. The initial top level (started with
\cmdlineoption{-t}) has value 0. See break/0. This flag is absent from
threads that are not running a top-level loop.

    \prologflagitem{bundle}{bool}{r}
True when SWI-Prolog is installed as a stand-alone bundle.  This is
set for both the Windows and MacOS binary packages as distributed
from the SWI-Prolog download page.  This is used to adjust the
file search configuration.

    \prologflagitem{c_cc}{atom}{rw}
Name of the C compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog.  Normally one of
\const{gcc}, \const{clang} or \const{cc}.  See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{c_cflags}{atom}{rw}
CFLAGS used to compile SWI-Prolog.  See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{c_cxx}{atom}{rw}
Name of the C++ compiler used to test the SWI-Prolog C++ binding. This
is the default C++ compiler used by \program{swipl-ld} (see
\secref{plld}) as well as compiling packs using the default setup. Note
that SWI-Prolog itself does not contain C++ code and the C++ binding is
\jargon{header only}. This implies that C++ ABI compatibility issues can
not occur.

    \prologflagitem{c_ldflags}{atom}{rw}
LDFLAGS used to link SWI-Prolog. See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{c_libplso}{atom}{rw}
Libraries needed to link extensions (shared object, DLL) to SWI-Prolog.
Typically empty on ELF systems and \const{-lswipl} on COFF-based
systems.  See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{c_libs}{atom}{rw}
Libraries needed to link executables that embed SWI-Prolog.  Typically
\const{-lswipl} if the SWI-Prolog kernel is a shared (DLL).  If the
SWI-Prolog kernel is in a static library, this flag also contains the
dependencies.

    \prologflagitem{char_conversion}{bool}{rw}
Determines whether character conversion takes place while reading terms.
See also char_conversion/2.

    \prologflagitem{character_escapes}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), read/1 interprets \verb$\$ escape sequences
in quoted atoms and strings. May be changed. This flag is local to the
module in which it is changed.  See \secref{charescapes}.

    \prologflagitem{character_escapes_unicode}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), write/1 and friends write escaped characters
using the \verb$\uXXXX$ or \verb$\UXXXXXXXX$ syntax rather than the
ISO Prolog \verb$\x<hex>\$ syntax.  SWI-Prolog reads both.

    \prologflagitem{ci_speedup}{float}{rw}
Consider generating a hash for clause indexing if the hash has
a speedup of at least this flag.  Default is 1.5.

    \prologflagitem{ci_max_var_fraction}{float}{rw}
Do not create a clause indexing hash table of the argument is
unbound in the clause for more than this fraction of clauses.
Default is 0.1.

    \prologflagitem{ci_min_speedup_ratio}{float}{rw}
Consider adding a multi-argument hash if it is at lease this
values as efficient.  Default is 3.0.

    \prologflagitem{ci_max_lookahead}{integer}{rw}
If a clause is found, scan the clause list of a possible
alternative match for at max this number of clauses.  Default
is 100.

    \prologflagitem{ci_min_clauses}{integer}{rw}
If the primary index argument (first) is instantiated, still
consider a hash of the predicate has more than this number of
clauses.  Default is 10.

    \prologflagitem{cmake_build_type}{atom}{ro}
Provides the \href{https://cmake.org/}{cmake} \jargon{build type} used
to build this version of SWI-Prolog.

    \prologflagitem{colon_sets_calling_context}{bool}{ro}
Using the construct <module>:<goal> sets the \jargon{calling context}
for executing <goal>.  This flag is defined by ISO/IEC 13211-2 (Prolog
modules standard).  See \secref{modules}.

    \prologflagitem{color_term}{bool}{rw}
This flag is managed by library \pllib{ansi_term}, which is loaded at
startup if the two conditions below are both true. Note that this
implies that setting this flag to \const{false} from the system or
personal initialization file (see \secref{initfile} disables colored
output.  The predicate message_property/2 can be used to control the
actual color scheme depending in the message type passed to
print_message/2.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \verb$stream_property(current_output, tty(true))$
    \item \verb$\+ current_prolog_flag(color_term, false)$
    \end{itemize}

    \prologflagitem{compile_meta_arguments}{atom}{rw}
This flag controls compilation of arguments passed to meta-calls marked
`0' or `\chr{^}' (see meta_predicate/1). Supported values are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{false}{}
(default). Meta-arguments are passed verbatim. If the argument is a
control structure ((A,B), (A;B), (A->B;C), etc.) it is compile to an
temporary clause allocated on the environment stack when the
meta-predicate is called.

    \termitem{control}{}
Compile meta-arguments that contain control structures to an auxiliary
predicate.  This generally improves performance as well as the debugging
experience.

    \termitem{always}{}
Always create an intermediate clause, even for system
predicates.\footnote{This may be used in the future for
replacing the normal head of the generated predicate with a special
reference (similar to database references as used by, e.g., assert/2)
that provides direct access to the executable code, thus avoiding
runtime lookup of predicates for meta-calling.}
\end{description}

    \prologflagitem{compiled_at}{atom}{r}
Describes when the system has been compiled. Only available if the
C compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog provides the __DATE__ and __TIME__
macros.

    \prologflagitem{conda}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} when built in a \href{https://docs.conda.io/}{Conda}
environment.

    \prologflagitem{console_menu}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} when the I/O is bound to an Epilog
(\program{swipl-win}) Prolog console to indicate that the console
supports menus. See also \secref{epilog-api}.

    \prologflagitem{cpu_count}{integer}{rw}
Number of physical CPUs or cores in the system. The flag is marked
read-write both to allow pretending the system has more or less
processors. See also thread_setconcurrency/2 and the library
\pllib{thread}. This flag is not available on systems where we do not
know how to get the number of CPUs. This flag is not included in a saved
state (see qsave_program/1).

    \prologflagitem{dde}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} if this instance of Prolog supports DDE as
described in \secref{DDE}.

    \prologflagitem{debug}{bool}{rw}
Switch debugging mode on/off.  If debug mode is activated the system
traps encountered spy points (see spy/1) and break points.
In addition, last-call optimisation is disabled and the system is
more conservative in destroying choice points to simplify debugging.

Disabling these optimisations can cause the system to run out of memory
on programs that behave correctly if debug mode is off.

    \prologflagitem{debug_on_error}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, start the tracer after an error is detected.
Otherwise just continue execution. The goal that raised the error will
normally fail. See also the Prolog flag \prologflag{report_error}.
Default is \const{true}.

    \prologflagitem{debug_on_interrupt}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, start the debugger on Control-C.\footnote{More
precisely when receiving \const{SIGINT}}.  The initial value is
\const{false} and the value is set to \const{true} when entering
the interactive top level.  See \cmdlineoption{--debug-on-interrupt}
to start handling interrupts immediately.

    \prologflagitem{debugger_show_context}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, show the context module while printing a stack-frame in
the tracer.  Normally controlled using the `C' option of the tracer.

    \prologflagitem{debugger_write_options}{term}{rw}
This argument is given as option-list to write_term/2 for printing goals
by the debugger.  Modified by the `w', `p' and `<N> d' commands of the
debugger.  Default is \texttt{[quoted(true), portray(true),
max_depth(10), attributes(portray)]}.

    \prologflagitem{determinism_error}{atom}{rw}
This flag defines the behaviour when the predicate determinism is not
according to its declaration. See det/1. Possible values are
\const{error} (default), \const{warning} and \const{silent}.

    \prologflagitem{dialect}{atom}{r}
Fixed to \const{swi}.  The code below is a reliable and portable way to
detect SWI-Prolog.

\begin{code}
is_dialect(swi) :-
	catch(current_prolog_flag(dialect, swi), _, fail).
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{dir_sep}{atom}{r}
Separator for directories in a file name the OS.  Normally \const{/},
but \const{\} on Windows.

    \prologflagitem{double_quotes}{codes,chars,atom,string}{rw}
This flag determines how double quoted strings are read by Prolog and is
---like \prologflag{character_escapes} and \prologflag{back_quotes}---
maintained for each module. The default is \const{string}, which
produces a string as described in \secref{string}. If
\cmdlineoption{--traditional} is given, the default is \const{codes},
which produces a list of character codes, integers that represent a
Unicode code-point. The value \const{chars} produces a list of
one-character atoms and the value \const{atom} makes double quotes the
same as single quotes, creating a atom.  See also \secref{extensions}.

    \prologflagitem{editor}{atom}{rw}
Determines the editor used by edit/1. See \secref{customedit} for
details on selecting the editor used.

    \prologflagitem{emacs_inferior_process}{bool}{r}
If true, SWI-Prolog is running as an \jargon{inferior process} of
(GNU/X-)Emacs.  SWI-Prolog assumes this is the case if the environment
variable \env{EMACS} is \const{t} and \env{INFERIOR} is \const{yes}.

    \prologflagitem{encoding}{atom}{rw}
Default encoding used for opening files in \const{text} mode. The
initial value is deduced from the environment. See \secref{encoding} for
details.

    \prologflagitem{executable}{atom}{r}
Pathname of the running executable. Used by qsave_program/2 as
default emulator.

   \prologflagitem{executable_format}{atom}{r}
Format of the SWI-Prolog executable, e.g. \const{elf} for when
\file{swipl} is an ELF binary file.

    \prologflagitem{engines}{bool}{r}
True if engines are supported.  This is always the case on the
multi-threaded versions.   Engines may be enabled on single
threaded versions of SWI-Prolog.

    \prologflagitem{exit_status}{integer}{r}
Set by halt/1 to its argument, making the exit status available to
hooks registered with at_halt/1.

    \prologflagitem{file_name_case_handling}{atom}{rw}
This flag defines how Prolog handles the case of file names. The flag is
used for case normalization and to determine whether two names refer to
the same file.\bug{Note that file name case handling is typically a
properly of the filesystem, while Prolog only has a global flag to
determine its file handling.}  It has one of the following values:

    \begin{description}
    \termitem{case_sensitive}{}
The filesystem is fully case sensitive.  Prolog does not perform
any case modification or case insensitive matching.  This is the
default on Unix systems.
    \termitem{case_preserving}{}
The filesystem is case insensitive, but it preserves the case with
which the user has created a file.  This is the default on Windows
systems.
    \termitem{case_insensitive}{}
The filesystem doesn't store or match case.  In this scenario Prolog
maps all file names to lower case.
    \end{description}

    \prologflagitem{file_name_variables}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), expand \file{\$\arg{varname}}
and \chr{~} in arguments of built-in predicates that accept a file
name (open/3, exists_file/1, access_file/2, etc.). The predicate
expand_file_name/2 can be used to expand environment variables and
wildcard patterns. This Prolog flag is intended for backward
compatibility with older versions of SWI-Prolog.

    \prologflagitem{file_search_cache_time}{number}{rw}
Time in seconds for which search results from absolute_file_name/3 are
cached. Within this time limit, the system will first check that the old
search result satisfies the conditions. Default is 10 seconds, which
typically avoids most repetitive searches for (library) files during
compilation. Setting this value to 0 (zero) disables the cache.

    \prologflagitem{float_max}{float}{r}
The biggest representable floating point number.

    \prologflagitem{float_max_integer}{float}{r}
The highest integer that can be represented precisely as a floating
point number.

    \prologflagitem{float_min}{float}{r}
The smallest representable floating point number above 0.0.  See also
\funcref{nexttoward}{2}.

    \prologflagitem{float_overflow}{atom}{rw}
One of \const{error} (default) or \const{infinity}.  The first is ISO
compliant.  Using \const{infinity}, floating point overflow is mapped
to positive or negative \const{Inf}.  See \secref{ieee-float}.  This
flag also affects read_term/3 and friends, causing them to read too
large floating point number as infinity.

    \prologflagitem{float_rounding}{atom}{rw}
Defines how arithmetic rounds to a float.  Defined values are
\const{to_nearest} (default), \const{to_positive}, \const{to_negative}
or \const{to_zero}. For most scenarios the function
\funcref{roundtoward}{2} provides a safer and faster alternative.

    \prologflagitem{float_undefined}{atom}{rw}
One of \const{error} (default) or \const{nan}. The first is ISO
compliant. Using \const{nan}, undefined operations such as
\term{sqrt}{-2.0} is mapped to \const{NaN}. See \secref{ieee-float}.

    \prologflagitem{float_underflow}{atom}{rw}
One of \const{error} or \const{ignore} (default). The second is ISO
compliant, binding the result to 0.0.

    \prologflagitem{float_zero_div}{atom}{rw}
One of \const{error} (default) or \const{infinity}. The first is ISO
compliant. Using \const{infinity}, division by 0.0 is mapped to positive
or negative \const{Inf}. See \secref{ieee-float}.

    \prologflagitem{gc}{bool}{rw}
If true (default), the garbage collector is active.  If false, neither
garbage collection, nor stack shifts will take place, even not on
explicit request.  May be changed.

    \prologflagitem{gc_thread}{bool}{r}
If \const{true} (default if threading is enabled), atom and
clause garbage collection are executed in a separate thread with the
\jargon{alias} \const{gc}. Otherwise the thread that detected sufficient
garbage executes the garbage collector. As running these global
collectors may take relatively long, using a separate thread improves
real time behaviour. The \const{gc} thread can be controlled using
set_prolog_gc_thread/1, which either enables the gc thread or kills
the gc thread and waits for it to die.

    \prologflagitem{generate_debug_info}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default) generate code that can be debugged using
trace/0, spy/1, etc. Can be set to \const{false} using the
\cmdlineoption{--no-debug}.   This flag is scoped within a source file.
Many of the libraries have
\verb$:- set_prolog_flag(generate_debug_info, false)$ to hide their
details from a normal trace.%
	\footnote{In the current implementation this only causes a flag
		  to be set on the predicate that causes children to be
		  hidden from the debugger. The name anticipates
		  further changes to the compiler.}

    \prologflagitem{gmp_version}{integer}{r}
If Prolog is linked with GMP, this flag gives the major version of the
GMP library used.  See also \secref{gmpforeign}.  This flag is not present
when linked to \href{https://bellard.org/libbf/}{LibBF}.  Use non-existence
of the Prolog flag \prologflag{bounded} to test for big integer and rational
number support.

    \prologflagitem{gui}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} if XPCE is around and can be used for graphics.

    \prologflagitem{halt_grace_time}{float}{rw}
Time halt/1 waits for other threads to die gracefully.  Default
is 1 second.

    \prologflagitem{heartbeat}{integer}{rw}
If not zero, call prolog:heartbeat/0 every $N$ inferences.  $N$ is
rounded to a multiple of 16.

    \prologflagitem{history}{integer}{rw}
If $\arg{integer}> 0$, support Unix \program{csh(1)}-like history as
described in \secref{history}. Otherwise, only support reusing commands
through the command line editor. The default is to set this Prolog flag
to 0 if a command line editor is provided (see Prolog flag
\prologflag{readline}) and 15 otherwise.

    \prologflagitem{home}{atom}{r}
SWI-Prolog's notion of the home directory. SWI-Prolog uses its home
directory to find its startup file as \file{<home>/boot.prc} and to find
its library as \file{<home>/library}. Some installations may put
architecture independent files in a \jargon{shared home} and also
define \prologflag{shared_home}.  System files can be found using
absolute_file_name/3 as \term{swi}{file}.  See file_search_path/2.

    \prologflagitem{integer_rounding_function}{down,toward_zero}{r}
ISO Prolog flag describing rounding by \verb$//$ and \verb$rem$ arithmetic
functions. Value depends on the C compiler used.

    \prologflagitem{iso}{bool}{rw}
Include some weird ISO compatibility that is incompatible with normal
SWI-Prolog behaviour.  Currently it has the following effect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \functor{/}{2} (float division) {\em always} returns a
          float, even if applied to integers that can be divided.
    \item In the standard order of terms (see \secref{standardorder}),
          all floats are before all integers.
    \item atom_length/2 yields a type error if the first
          argument is a number.
    \item clause/[2,3] raises a permission error when accessing static
          predicates.
    \item abolish/[1,2] raises a permission error when accessing static
          predicates.
    \item Syntax is closer to the ISO standard:
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item Within functional notation and list notation terms must have priority
		      below 1000.  That means that rules and control constructs
		      appearing as arguments need bracketing.
		      A term like \exam{[a :- b, c].} must now be disambiguated
		      to mean \exam{[(a :- b), c].} or \exam{[(a :- b, c)].}
		\item Operators appearing as operands must be bracketed.
		      Instead of \exam{X == -, true.} write \exam{X == (-), true.}
		      Currently, this is not entirely enforced.
		\item Backslash-escaped newlines are interpreted according to
		      the ISO standard.  See \secref{charescapes}.
	  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \prologflagitem{large_files}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, SWI-Prolog has been compiled with
\jargon{large file support} (LFS) and is capable of accessing files larger
than 2GB. This flag is always \const{true} on 64-bit hardware and true
on 32-bit hardware if the configuration detected support for LFS.  Note
that it may still be the case that the \jargon{file system} on which a
particular file resides puts limits on the file size.

    \prologflagitem{last_call_optimisation}{bool}{rw}
Determines whether or not last-call optimisation is enabled. Normally
the value of this flag is the negation of the \prologflag{debug} flag.
As programs may run out of stack if last-call optimisation is omitted,
it is sometimes necessary to enable it during debugging.

   \prologflagitem{libswipl}{atom}{rw}
Path where the SWI-Prolog shared library \file{libswipl}, the
SWI-Prolog shared object that provides Prolog, resides.  On some
systems this can be determined reliably from the running system.  On
these systems the flag is \emph{read-only}.  On other systems it is
the configured target installation location and thus this value can be
wrong if the installation has been relocated.  As we do not have a
cross-platform reliable way to compute this path the flag is
read-write on such platforms.\footnote{When running from the build
environment, this flag is adjusted to reflect the location in the
build tree.}

Currently, this flag is reliable on Windows and POSIX systems
providing the dladdr() function.  This function is provided on Linux
and MacOS.

    \prologflagitem{linux}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, the OS is some form of Linux. See
also \prologflag{unix}.

    \prologflagitem{malloc}{atom}{r}
Set after a successful identification of the used malloc()
implementation.  Currently possibly values are \const{tcmalloc} and
\const{ptmalloc}.  See \secref{malloc} for details.

    \prologflagitem{max_answers_for_subgoal}{integer}{rw}
Limit the number of answers in a table. The atom
\const{infinite} clears the flag.  By default this flag is not defined.
See \secref{tabling-restraints} for details.

    \prologflagitem{max_answers_for_subgoal_action}{atom}{rw}
The action taken when a table reaches the number of
answers specified in \prologflag{max_answers_for_subgoal}. Supported values
are \const{bounded_rationality}, \const{error} (default) or
\const{suspend}.

    \prologflagitem{max_arity}{unbounded}{r}
ISO Prolog flag describing there is no maximum arity to compound terms.

    \prologflagitem{max_char_code}{integer}{r}
Highest (Unicode) code point that is supported.  SWI-Prolog supports
all Unicode code points from 0 (zero) up to and including the value of
this flag. Currently \const{0xffff} on Windows (UCS-2) and
\const{0x10ffff} on most other platforms.

    \prologflagitem{max_integer}{integer}{r}
Maximum integer value if integers are \emph{bounded}.  See also
the flag \prologflag{bounded} and \secref{artypes}.

    \prologflagitem{max_integer_size}{integer}{rw}
When this tripwire is set, memory allocation on behalf of big integers
and rational numbers is limited to given number of bytes.  The minimum
value is 1,000.  When unset, the allocation limit is determined by the
stack limit as we cannot represent larger numbers or malloc()
failures.  Notably services that may process arbitrary arithmetic
expressions on behalf of a client may set this limit to avoid resource
exhaustion.

    \prologflagitem{max_procedure_arity}{integer}{r}
Maximum arity for a predicate.  An attempt to define or call such a
predicate results in a \exam{representation_error(max_procedure_arity)}
exception.  Currently set to 1024.

    \prologflagitem{max_rational_size}{integer}{rw}
Limit the size in bytes for rational numbers. This \jargon{tripwire} can
be used to identify cases where setting the Prolog flag
\prologflag{prefer_rationals} to \const{true} creates excessively big
rational numbers and, if precision is not required, one should use
floating point arithmetic.  Note that rationals are also implicitly
limited by the Prolog flag \prologflag{max_integer_size}.

    \prologflagitem{max_rational_size_action}{atom}{rw}
Action when the \prologflag{max_rational_size} tripwire is exceeded.
Possible values are \const{error} (default), which throws a tripwire
resource error and \const{float}, which converts the rational number
into a floating point number. Note that rational numbers may exceed the
range for floating point numbers.

    \prologflagitem{max_table_answer_size}{integer}{rw}
Limit the size of an answer substitution for tabling.  The atom
\const{infinite} clears the flag.  By default this flag is not defined.
See \secref{tabling-restraints} for details.

    \prologflagitem{max_table_answer_size_action}{atom}{rw}
The action taken if an answer substitution larger than
\prologflag{max_table_answer_size} is added to a table. Supported values
are \const{error} (default), \const{bounded_rationality},
\const{suspend} and \const{fail}.

    \prologflagitem{max_table_subgoal_size}{integer}{rw}
Limit the size of a goal term accessing a table.  The atom
\const{infinite} clears the flag.  By default this flag is not defined.
See \secref{tabling-restraints} for details.

    \prologflagitem{max_table_subgoal_size_action}{atom}{rw}
The action taken if a tabled goal exceeds
\prologflag{max_table_subgoal_size}.  Supported values
are \const{error} (default), \const{abstract} and \const{suspend}.

    \prologflagitem{max_tagged_integer}{integer}{r}
Maximum integer value represented as a `tagged' value.  Tagged integers
require one word storage.  Larger integers are represented as `indirect data'
and require significantly more space.

    \prologflagitem{message_context}{list(atom)}{rw}
Context information to add to messages of the levels \const{error} and
\const{warning}.  The list may contain the elements \const{thread} to
add the thread that generates the message to the message, \const{time}
or \term{time}{Format} to add a time stamp.  The default time format
is \verb$%T.%3f$. The default is \exam{[thread]}. See also format_time/3
and print_message/2.

    \prologflagitem{min_integer}{integer}{r}
Minimum integer value if integers are \emph{bounded}.  See also
the flag \prologflag{bounded} and \secref{artypes}.

    \prologflagitem{min_tagged_integer}{integer}{r}
Start of the tagged-integer value range.

    \prologflagitem{mitigate_spectre}{bool}{rw}
When \const{true} (default \const{false}), enforce mitigation against
the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)}{Spectre}
timing-based security vulnerability. Spectre based attacks can extract
information from memory owned by the process that should remain
invisible, such as passwords or the private key of a web server. The
attacks work by causing speculative access to sensitive data, and
leaking the data via side-channels such as differences in the duration
of successive instructions. An example of a potentially vulnerable
application is \href{https://swish.swi-prolog.org}{SWISH}. SWISH
allows users to run Prolog code while the swish server must protect
the privacy of other users as well as its HTTPS private keys, cookies
and passwords.

Currently, enabling this flag reduces the resolution of get_time/1 and
statistics/2 CPU time to $20\mu{}s$.

\textbf{WARNING}: Although a coarser timer makes a successful attack
of this type harder, it does not reliably prevent such attacks in
general. Full mitigation may require compiler support to disable
speculative access to sensitive data.

    \prologflagitem{msys2}{bool}{r}
If present, SWI-Prolog is the MS-Windows version running under
a \href{https://www.msys2.org/}{MSYS2} shell.

    \prologflagitem{occurs_check}{atom}{rw}
This flag controls unification that creates an infinite tree (also
called \jargon{cyclic term}) and can have three values. Using
\const{false} (default), unification succeeds, creating an infinite
tree. Using \const{true}, unification behaves as unify_with_occurs_check/2,
failing silently. Using \const{error}, an attempt to create a cyclic
term results in an \except{occurs_check} exception. The latter
is intended for debugging unintentional creations of cyclic terms. Note
that this flag is a global flag modifying fundamental behaviour of
Prolog. Changing the flag from its default may cause libraries to stop
functioning properly.

    \prologflagitem{on_error}{atom}{rw}
Determines how to act on an error printed using print_message/2, i.e.,
an error that is reported to the user. The possible values are
\const{print} (default), \const{status} and \const{halt}. Using
\const{halt} the process halts immediately with status 1. Otherwise
execution continues.  Using \const{status} halt/0 exits with status
1 if one or more errors were printed by the process. In \jargon{compile}
mode (see \cmdlineoption{-c}) the default is \const{status}.  This flag
can be set from the commandline using \cmdlineoption{--on-error}.
See also \secref{compilation-messages}.

    \prologflagitem{on_warning}{atom}{rw}
As \prologflag{on_error}, but for warnings.  The default is always
\const{print}.  The commandline option is \cmdlineoption{--on-warning}.

    \prologflagitem{open_shared_object}{bool}{r}
If true, open_shared_object/2 and friends are implemented, providing
access to shared libraries (\fileext{so} files) or dynamic link
libraries (\fileext{DLL} files).

    \prologflagitem{optimise}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, compile in optimised mode. The initial value is
\const{true} if Prolog was started with the \cmdlineoption{-O}
command line option.  The \prologflag{optimise} flag is scoped to
a source file.

Currently optimised compilation implies compilation of arithmetic,
and deletion of redundant true/0 that may result from expand_goal/2.

Later versions might imply various other optimisations such as
integrating small predicates into their callers, eliminating constant
expressions and other predictable constructs. Source code optimisation
is never applied to predicates that are declared dynamic (see
dynamic/1).

    \prologflagitem{optimise_unify}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), allow the compiler to (re)move explicit
unification calls (\predref{=}{2}). While this behaviour can
significantly improve performance, it is not yet handled properly by
the source-level debugger. See \secref{indexbody}.

    \prologflagitem{os_argv}{list}{rw}
List is a list of atoms representing the command line arguments used to
invoke SWI-Prolog.  Please note that {\bf all} arguments are included
in the list returned.  See \prologflag{argv} to get the application
options.

    \prologflagitem{packs}{bool}{r}
If \const{true}, extension packs (add-ons) are attached.  Can be set to
\const{false} using the \cmdlineoption{--no-packs}.

    \prologflagitem{path_max}{integer}{r}
Maximum length of a file pathname as reported by the OS. This length
does typically not directly define the number of characters in the file
name.  The actual limit may be shorter due to jargon{encoding} (e.g.,
on POSIX systems it typically defines the length limit of the (often)
UTF-8 encoded name).  The underlying file system may impose additional
limits.

    \prologflagitem{path_sep}{atom}{r}
Separator for file search paths such as the environment variable
\const{PATH} for the OS.  Normally \const{:}, but \const{;} on
Windows.

    \prologflagitem{pid}{int}{r}
Process identifier of the running Prolog process.  Existence of this
flag is implementation-defined.

    \prologflagitem{pipe}{bool}{rw}
If true, \exam{open(pipe(command), mode, Stream)}, etc.\ are supported.
Can be changed to disable the use of pipes in applications testing this
feature.  Not recommended.

    \prologflagitem{portable_vmi}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), generate \fileext{qlf} files and saved states
that run both on 32 bit and 64-bit hardware.  If \const{false}, some
optimized virtual machine instructions are only used if the integer
argument is within the range of a tagged integer for 32-bit machines.

    \prologflagitem{posix_shell}{atom}{rw}
Path to a POSIX compatible shell.  This default is typically
\file{/bin/sh}.  This flag is used by shell/1 and qsave_program/2.

    \prologflagitem{prefer_rationals}{bool}{rw}
Only provided if the system is compiled with unbounded and rational
arithmetic support (see \prologflag{bounded}). If \const{true},
prefer arithmetic to produce rational numbers over floats. This implies:

    \begin{itemize}
	\item Division (\funcref{/}{2}) of two integers produces a
	rational number.
	\item Power (\funcref{^}{2}) of two integers produces a
	rational number, \emph{also} if the second operand is a
	negative number.  For example, \verb$2^(-2)$ evaluates to
	\verb$1/4$.
    \end{itemize}

Using \const{true} can create excessively large rational numbers. The
Prolog flag \prologflag{max_rational_size} can be used to detect and
act on this \jargon{tripwire}.

If \const{false}, rational numbers can only be created using the
functions \funcref{rational}{1}, \funcref{rationalize}{1} and
\funcref{rdiv}{2} or by reading them. See also
\prologflag{rational_syntax}, \secref{syntax-rational-numbers} and
\secref{rational}.

The current default is \const{false}.  We consider changing this to
\const{true} in the future.  Users are strongly encouraged to set
this flag to \const{true} and report issues this may cause.

    \prologflagitem{print_write_options}{term}{rw}
Specifies the options for write_term/2 used by print/1 and print/2.

    \prologflagitem{prompt_alternatives_on}{atom}{rw}
\index{prompt, alternatives}%
Determines prompting for alternatives in the Prolog top level. Default is
\const{determinism}, which implies the system prompts for alternatives
if the goal succeeded while leaving choice points.  Many classical Prolog
systems behave as \const{groundness}: they prompt for alternatives if
and only if the query contains variables.

    \prologflagitem{protect_static_code}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), clause/2 does not operate on
static code, providing some basic protection from hackers that wish to
list the static code of your Prolog program. Once the flag is
\const{true}, it cannot be changed back to \const{false}.  Protection
is default in ISO mode (see Prolog flag \prologflag{iso}).  Note that
many parts of the development environment require clause/2 to work on
static code, and enabling this flag should thus only be used for
production code.

    \prologflagitem{qcompile}{atom}{rw}
This option provides the default for the \term{qcompile}{+Atom} option
of load_files/2.

    \prologflagitem{rational_syntax}{atom}{rw}
Determines the read and write syntax for rational numbers. Possible
values are \const{natural} (e.g., \exam{1/3}) or \const{compatibility}
(e.g., \exam{1r3}). The \const{compatibility} syntax is always accepted.
This flag is module sensitive.

The default for this flag is currently \const{compatibility}, which
reads and writes rational numbers as e.g., \exam{1r3}.\footnote{There is
still some discussion on the separating character. See
\secref{syntax-rational-numbers}.} We will consider \const{natural} as a
default in the future. Users are strongly encouraged to set this flag to
\const{natural} and report issues this may cause.

    \prologflagitem{rationals}{atom}{r}
This flag is present and has the value \const{true} if the system
supports rational numbers.  For SWI-Prolog this flag is always set
if the flag \prologflag{bounded} is \const{false}.

    \prologflagitem{readline}{atom}{rw}
Specifies which form of command line editing is provided. Possible
values are below.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{false}{}
No command line editing is available.

    \termitem{editline}{}
The library \pllib{editline} is loaded, providing line editing based on
the BSD libedit.  This is the default if \pllib{editline} is available
and can be loaded.
\end{description}

    \prologflagitem{report_error}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, print error messages; otherwise suppress them. May
be changed. See also the \prologflag{debug_on_error} Prolog flag.
Default is \const{true}, except for the runtime version.

    \prologflagitem{resource_database}{atom}{r}
Set to the absolute filename of the attached state.  Typically this is
the file \file{boot32.prc}, the file specified with \cmdlineoption{-x}
or the running executable.  See also resource/3.

    \prologflagitem{runtime}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, SWI-Prolog is compiled with -DO_RUNTIME,
disabling various useful development features (currently the tracer and
profiler).

    \prologflagitem{sandboxed_load}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), load_files/2 calls hooks to
allow library(sandbox) to verify the safety of directives.

    \prologflagitem{saved_program}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, Prolog has been started from a state saved
with qsave_program/[1,2].

    \prologflagitem{shared_home}{atom}{r}
Indicates that part of the SWI-Prolog system files are installed in
\file{<prefix>/share/swipl} instead of in the home at the
\file{<prefix>/lib/swipl}.  This flag indicates the location of this
\emph{shared home} and the directory is added to the file search path
\const{swi}.  See file_search_path/2 and the flag \prologflag{home}.

    \prologflagitem{shared_object_extension}{atom}{r}
Extension used by the operating system for shared objects. \fileext{so}
for most Unix systems and \fileext{dll} for Windows.  Used for locating
files using the \const{file_type} \const{executable}.  See also
absolute_file_name/3.

    \prologflagitem{shared_object_search_path}{atom}{r}
Name of the environment variable used by the system to search for shared
objects.

    \prologflagitem{shared_table_space}{integer}{rw}
Space reserved for storing shared answer tables. See
\secref{tabling-shared} and the Prolog flag \prologflag{table_space}.

    \prologflagitem{shift_check}{bool}{rw}
When \const{true} (default \const{false}), check for suspicious
delimited continuations captured by shift_for_copy/1.

    \prologflagitem{signals}{bool}{r}
Determine whether Prolog is handling signals (software interrupts). This
flag is \const{false} if the hosting OS does not support signal handling
or the command line option \cmdlineoption{--no-signals} is active.  See
\secref{sigembedded} for details.

    \prologflagitem{source}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, ignore \fileext{qlf} files if there is a
corresponding \fileext{pl} file.  The provided \fileext{qlf} files in
the library are compiled with optimization enabled (see
\prologflag{optimise}), macro expansion enabled (see
\pllib{apply_macros}) and debug/3 and assertion/1 statements removed.
Using this flag loads the source, providing better support for
debugging.  If a debugging session may benefit from better access to
the debugging facilities of the libraries, either set this Prolog flag
at the start of the load file for your program or start Prolog as

\begin{code}
swipl -Dsource [option ...] myfile.pl ...
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{source_search_working_directory}{bool}{rw}
If set to \const{true}, loading a relative file name from source code
searches relative to the location of the source file as well as relative
to the working directory. Searching relative to the working directory is
deprecated and a warning is printed if the file is found this way.
Future versions are likely to change the default to
\const{false}.\footnote{Searching the working directory was supported up
to version 9.3.8. Version 9.3.9 disabled this and version 9.3.10
re-enables it with a warning.}

    \prologflagitem{stack_limit}{int}{rw}
Limits the combined sizes of the Prolog stacks for the current thread.
See also \cmdlineoption{--stack-limit} and \secref{memlimit}.

    \prologflagitem{stream_type_check}{atom}{rw}
Defines whether and how strictly the system validates that byte I/O
should not be applied to text streams and text I/O should not be applied
to binary streams. Values are \const{false} (no checking), \const{true}
(full checking) and \const{loose}.  Using checking mode \const{loose}
(default), the system accepts byte I/O from text stream that use ISO
Latin-1 encoding and accepts writing text to binary streams.

    \prologflagitem{string_stack_tripwire}{int}{rw}
Maintenance for foreign language string management.  Prints a warning
if the string stack depth hits the tripwire value. See
\secref{foreign-strings} for details.

    \prologflagitem{system_thread_id}{int}{r}
Available in multithreaded version (see \secref{threads}) where the
operating system provides system-wide integer thread identifiers. The
integer is the thread identifier used by the operating system for the
calling thread.  On Linux systems this is the PID of the thread.

    \prologflagitem{table_incremental}{bool}{rw}
Set the default for whether to use incremental tabling or not.
Initially set to \const{false}.  See table/1.

    \prologflagitem{table_shared}{bool}{rw}
Set the default for whether to use shared tabling or not.
Initially set to \const{false}.  See table/1.

    \prologflagitem{table_space}{integer}{rw}
Space reserved for storing answer tables for \jargon{tabled predicates}
(see table/1).\bug{Currently only counts the space occupied by the
nodes in the answer tries.} When exceeded a
\term{resource_error}{table_space} exception is raised.

    \prologflagitem{table_subsumptive}{bool}{rw}
Set the default choice between \jargon{variant} tabling and
\jargon{subsumptive} tabling.  Initially set to \const{false}.  See
table/1.

    \prologflagitem{threads}{bool}{rw}
True when threads are supported.  If the system is compiled without
thread support the value is \const{false} and read-only.  Otherwise
the value is \const{true} unless the system was started with the
\cmdlineoption{--no-threads}.  Threading may be disabled only if no
threads are running.  See also the \prologflag{gc_thread} flag.

    \prologflagitem{timezone}{integer}{r}
Offset in seconds west of GMT of the current time zone. Set at
initialization time from the \const{timezone} variable associated with
the POSIX tzset() function. See also format_time/3.

    \prologflagitem{tmp_dir}{atom}{rw}
Path to the temporary directory. initialised from the environment
variable \const{TMP} or \const{TEMP} in windows. If this variable is not
defined a default is used. This default is typically \file{/tmp} or
\file{c:/temp} in windows.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_goal}{term}{rw}
Defines the goal that is executed after running the initialization goals
and entry point (see \cmdlineoption{-g}, initialization/2 and
\secref{plscript}. The initial value is \const{default}, starting a
normal interactive session. This value may be changed using the command
line option \cmdlineoption{-t}. The explicit value \const{prolog} is
equivalent to \const{default}. If \term{initialization}{Goal,main} is
used and the toplevel is \const{default}, the toplevel is set to
\const{halt} (see halt/0).

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_list_wfs_residual_program}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default) and the answer is \jargon{undefined} according
to the Well Founded Semantics (see \secref{WFS}), list the
\jargon{residual program} before the answer. Otherwise the answer
terminated with \textbf{undefined}. See also undefined/0.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_mode}{atom}{rw}
If \const{backtracking} (default), the toplevel backtracks after
completing a query. If \const{recursive}, the toplevel is implemented as
a recursive loop. This implies that global variables set using
b_setval/2 are maintained between queries. In \jargon{recursive}
mode, answers to toplevel variables (see \secref{topvars}) are kept
in backtrackable global variables and thus \textbf{not copied}.  In
\jargon{backtracking} mode answers to toplevel variables are kept in
the recorded database (see \secref{recdb}).

The recursive mode has been added for interactive usage of CHR (see
\secref{chr}),\footnote{Suggested by Falco Nogatz} which maintains the
global constraint store in backtrackable global variables.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_name_variables}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), give names to variables at the toplevel
instead of printing them as \arg{_NNN}.  The variables are named
\arg{_A}, \arg{_B}, ...  Variables that appear only once (singletons)
are printed as \arg{_}.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_print_anon}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, top-level variables starting with an underscore
(\chr{_}) are printed normally.  If \const{false} (default) the
binding of such variables are omitted from the answer.  This may be
used to hide bindings in complex queries from the top level.  For example,
the binding for \arg{_List} below is not printed.

\begin{code}
?- numlist(1,1 000 000,_List), sum_list(_List, Sum).
Sum = 500000500000.
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_print_factorized}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}) show the internal sharing of
subterms in the answer substitution.  The example below reveals internal
sharing of leaf nodes in \jargon{red-black trees} as implemented by the
\pllib{rbtrees} predicate \libpredref{rb_new}{1}:

\begin{code}
?- set_prolog_flag(toplevel_print_factorized, true).
?- rb_new(X).
X = t(_S1, _S1), % where
    _S1 = black('', _G387, _G388, '').
\end{code}

If this flag is \const{false}, the \verb!% where! notation is still used
to indicate cycles as illustrated below. This example also shows that
the implementation reveals the internal cycle length, and \emph{not} the
minimal cycle length. Cycles of different length are indistinguishable
in Prolog (as illustrated by \verb!S == R!).

\begin{code}
?- S = s(S), R = s(s(R)), S == R.
S = s(S),
R = s(s(R)).
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_prompt}{atom}{rw}
Define the prompt that is used by the interactive top level. The
following \verb$~$ (tilde) sequences are replaced:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\chr{~}m & \jargon{Type in} module if not \const{user}
	   (see module/1) \\
\chr{~}l & \jargon{Break level} if not 0
	   (see break/0) \\
\chr{~}d & \jargon{Debugging state} if not normal execution
	   (see debug/0, trace/0) \\
\chr{~}! & \jargon{History event} if history is enabled
           (see flag \prologflag{history}) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_residue_vars}{bool}{rw}
When \const{true} (default \const{false}), print residual variables as
detected by call_residue_vars/2 that do not appear in the bindings
returned by the goal.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_thread}{bool}{rw}
When \const{true}, this thread is running a toplevel REPL loop.  See
prolog/0.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_var_size}{int}{rw}
Maximum size counted in literals of a term returned as a binding for a
variable in a top-level query that is saved for re-use using the
\chr{$} variable reference. When 0 (zero), the variable recording
and reuse is disabled. See \secref{topvars}.

    \prologflagitem{trace_gc}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), garbage collections and
stack-shifts will be reported on the terminal. May be changed. Values
are reported in bytes as $G$+$T$, where $G$ is the global stack value
and $T$ the trail stack value. `Gained' describes the number of bytes
reclaimed. `used' the number of bytes on the stack after GC and `free'
the number of bytes allocated, but not in use. Below is an example
output.

\begin{code}
% GC: gained 236,416+163,424 in 0.00 sec;
      used 13,448+5,808; free 72,568+47,440
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{traditional}{bool}{r}
Available in SWI-Prolog version~7.  If \const{true}, `traditional'
mode has been selected using \cmdlineoption{--traditional}.  Notice
that some SWI7 features, like the functional notation on dicts, do not
work in this mode.  See also \secref{extensions}.

    \prologflagitem{tty_control}{bool}{rw}
Determines whether the terminal is switched to raw mode for
get_single_char/1, which also reads the user actions for the trace. May
be set. If this flag is \const{false} at startup, command line editing
is disabled. See also the \cmdlineoption{--no-tty} command line option.

    \prologflagitem{unix}{bool}{r}
\index{unix}%
If present and \const{true}, the operating system is some version of
Unix. Defined if the C compiler used to compile this version of
SWI-Prolog either defines \verb$__unix__$ or \const{unix}. On other
systems this flag is not available.  See also \prologflag{linux},
\prologflag{apple} and \prologflag{windows}.

    \prologflagitem{unknown}{fail,warning,error}{rw}
Determines the behaviour if an undefined procedure is encountered. If
\const{fail}, the predicate fails silently. If \const{warn}, a warning
is printed, and execution continues as if the predicate was not defined,
and if \const{error} (default), an \except{existence_error} exception is
raised. This flag is local to each module and inherited from the
module's \jargon{import-module}. Using default setup, this implies that
normal modules inherit the flag from \const{user}, which in turn
inherit the value \const{error} from \const{system}.  The user may
change the flag for module \const{user} to change the default for all
application modules or for a specific module.  It is strongly advised
to keep the \const{error} default and use dynamic/1 and/or multifile/1
to specify possible non-existence of a predicate.

    \prologflagitem{unknown_option}{ignore,warning,error}{rw}
Determines the behaviour if a predicate that processes an option list
is passed an option that is not understood by the predicate.  The ISO
standard dictates raising a \const{domain_error} exception.  This is
considered impractical as it makes it hard to write portable code if
different Prolog systems support different options and it makes it
hard to write predicates that process options and pass some of the
options to one predicate and others to some other predicate.  For
example, a predicate reading a file to a list of terms must distribute
options to open/4 and read_term/3.  SWI-Prolog has always ignored
unknown options unless in ISO mode (see the \prologflag{iso} flag).
This flag provides full control over how options are processed.

    \prologflagitem{unload_foreign_libraries}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), unload all loaded foreign
libraries.  Default is \const{false} because modern OSes reclaim the
resources anyway and unloading the foreign code may cause registered
hooks to point to no longer existing data or code.

    \prologflagitem{user_flags}{Atom}{rw}
Define the behaviour of set_prolog_flag/2 if the flag is not known.
Values are \const{silent}, \const{warning} and \const{error}. The first
two create the flag on-the-fly, where \const{warning} prints a message.
The value \const{error} is consistent with ISO: it raises an existence
error and does not create the flag. See also create_prolog_flag/3.  The
default is \const{silent}, but future versions may change that.
Developers are encouraged to use another value and ensure proper use
of create_prolog_flag/3 to create flags for their library.

    \prologflagitem{var_prefix}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), variables must start with an
underscore (\chr{_}).  May be changed. This flag is local to the
module in which it is changed.  See \secref{varprefix}.

    \prologflagitem{var_tag}{Atom}{rw}
This flag controls the interpretation of \arg{Tag}\{\ldots\} if
\arg{Tag} is unbound.  Possible values are:

    \begin{description}
    \termitem{dict}{}
Read as a dict (see \secref{bidicts}) with unbound tag.  This is the
current default. The use of unbound tags is deprecated.  In due time
the default will be changed, ultimately to \const{attvar}.  See
\secref{ext-dict-compat}.
    \termitem{attvar}
Read \verb$Var{...}$ as an attributed variable.  This is likely to
become the future default.
    \termitem{#}{}
Read \verb$Var{...}$ as \verb$#{...}$.  This flag allows to quickly
assess the impact on your code of using \verb$#{...}$ rather than
dicts with unbound tags.
    \termitem{warning}{}
As \chr{#}, but prints a warning.
    \termitem{error}{}
Considers \verb$Var{...}$ a syntax error.
    \end{description}

    \prologflagitem{verbose}{atom}{rw}
This flag is used by print_message/2.  If its value is \const{silent},
messages of type \const{informational} and \const{banner} are suppressed.
The \cmdlineoption{-q} switches the value from the initial
\const{normal} to \const{silent}.

    \prologflagitem{verbose_autoload}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} the normal consult message will be printed if a library
is autoloaded. By default this message is suppressed. Intended to be
used for debugging purposes.

    \prologflagitem{verbose_file_search}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), print messages indicating the
progress of absolute_file_name/[2,3] in locating files.  Intended for
debugging complicated file-search paths.  See also file_search_path/2.

    \prologflagitem{verbose_load}{atom}{rw}
Determines messages printed for loading (compiling) Prolog files.
Current values are \const{full} (print a message at the start and end of
each file loaded), \const{normal} (print a message at the end of each
file loaded), \const{brief} (print a message at end of loading the
toplevel file), and \const{silent} (no messages are printed, default).
The value of this flag is normally controlled by the option
\term{silent}{Bool} provided by load_files/2.

    \prologflagitem{version}{integer}{r}
The version identifier is an integer with value: $$10000 \times
\arg{Major} + 100 \times \arg{Minor} + \arg{Patch}$$

    \prologflagitem{version_data}{swi(Major, Minor, Patch, Extra)}{r}
Part of the dialect compatibility layer; see also the Prolog flag
\prologflag{dialect} and \secref{dialect}. \arg{Extra} provides
platform-specific version information as a list. \arg{Extra} is used for
\jargon{tagged versions} such as ``7.4.0-rc1'', in which case
\arg{Extra} contains a term \term{tag}{rc1}.

    \prologflagitem{version_git}{atom}{r}
Available if created from a git repository.  See \program{git-describe}
for details.

    \prologflagitem{vmi_builtin}{bool}{rw}
Determines whether well known built-ins such as true/0 or atom/1 are
handled by their translation into virtual machine code.  The default
for this flag is \const{true}, unless debug mode is enabled. Setting
this flag to \const{false} may improve other runtime instrumentation
results.  Note that optimized arithmetic (\cmdlineoption{-O}, see
Prolog flag \prologflag{optimise}) is currently not translated into
a normal predicate call.

    \prologflagitem{warn_autoload}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), warn when autoloading
predicates from a file that defines global term- or goal-expansion
rules.  These rules typically enhance performance or provide cleaner
semantics and thus autoloading is not recommended.   Future versions
will enable this flag by default.

    \prologflagitem{warn_override_implicit_import}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), a warning is printed if an implicitly
imported predicate is clobbered by a local definition.  See
use_module/1 for details.

    \prologflagitem{win_file_access_check}{atom}{rw}
Controls the behaviour or access_file/2 under Windows. There is no
reliable way to check access to files and directories on Windows. This
flag allows for switching between three alternative approximations.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{access}{}
Use Windows _waccess() function. This ignores ACLs (Access Control
List) and thus may indicate that access is allowed while it is not.
    \termitem{getfilesecurity}{}
Use the Windows GetFileSecurity() function.  This does not work on
all file systems, but is probably the best choice on file systems
that do support it, notably local NTFS volumes.
    \termitem{openclose}{}
Try to open the file and close it.  This works reliable for files,
but not for directories.  Currently directories are checked using
_waccess().  This is the default.
\end{description}

    \prologflagitem{windows}{bool}{r}
\index{windows}%
If present and \const{true}, the operating system is an implementation
of Microsoft Windows. This flag is only available on MS-Windows based
versions.  See also \prologflag{unix}.

    \prologflagitem{wine_version}{atom}{r}
If present, SWI-Prolog is the MS-Windows version running under
the \href{https://www.winehq.org/}{Wine} emulator.

    \prologflagitem{write_attributes}{atom}{rw}
Defines how write/1 and friends write attributed variables.  The option
values are described with the \const{attributes} option of
write_term/2.  Default is \const{ignore}.

    \prologflagitem{write_help_with_overstrike}{bool}{r}
Internal flag used by help/1 when writing to a terminal. If
present and \const{true} it prints bold and underlined text using
\jargon{overstrike}.

    \prologflagitem{xdg}{bool}{r(w)}
This flag defines whether or not the we follow the Free Desktop
standard for application data and configuration files.   The flag is
\const{true} and read-only for non-Windows systems.  On Windows
systems the flag is \const{true} but read-write when compiled under
\jargon{Conda} or \const{MSYS2} and not defined otherwise.  On
Windows, the search order is

\begin{description}
   \definition{Flag is not defined}
First search the Windows directories, then the XDG directories.
This is the default for the Windows binaries.
   \definition{Flag is \const{true}}
Only search the XDG directories.
   \definition{Flag is \const{false}}
Only search the Windows directories.
\end{description}

    \prologflagitem{xpce}{bool}{r}
Available and set to \const{true} if the XPCE graphics system is loaded.

    \prologflagitem{xpce_version}{atom}{r}
Available and set to the version of the loaded XPCE system.

    \prologflagitem{xref}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, source code is being read for \emph{analysis} purposes
such as cross-referencing.  Otherwise (default) it is being read to be
compiled.  This flag is used at several places by term_expansion/2 and
goal_expansion/2 hooks, notably if these hooks use side effects.  See
also the libraries \pllib{prolog_source} and \pllib{prolog_xref}.
\end{description}

    \predicate[ISO]{set_prolog_flag}{2}{:Key, +Value}
Define a new Prolog flag or change its value.  \arg{Key} is an atom.
If the flag is a system-defined flag that is not marked
\jargon{changeable} above, an attempt to modify the flag yields a
\except{permission_error}.  If the provided \arg{Value} does not
match the type of the flag, a \except{type_error} is raised.

Some flags (e.g., \prologflag{unknown}) are maintained on a per-module
basis. The addressed module is determined by the \arg{Key} argument.

In addition to ISO, SWI-Prolog allows for user-defined Prolog flags. The
type of the flag is determined from the initial value and cannot be
changed afterwards. Defined types are \const{boolean} (if the initial
value is one of \const{false}, \const{true}, \const{on} or \const{off}),
\const{atom} if the initial value is any other atom, \const{integer} if
the value is an integer that can be expressed as a 64-bit signed value.
Any other initial value results in an untyped flag that can represent
any valid Prolog term.

The behaviour when \arg{Key} denotes a non-existent key depends on the
Prolog flag \prologflag{user_flags}. The default is to define them
silently. New code is encouraged to use create_prolog_flag/3 for
portability.

    \predicate[YAP]{create_prolog_flag}{3}{+Key, +Value, +Options}
Create a new Prolog flag.  The ISO standard does not foresee creation
of new flags, but many libraries introduce new flags.  \arg{Options}
is a list of the options below.  See also \prologflag{user_flags}.

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{access}{+Access}
	Define access rights for the flag. Values are \const{read_write}
	and \const{read_only}.  The default is \const{read_write}.

	\termitem{type}{+Atom}
	Define a type restriction.  Possible values are
	\const{boolean}, \const{atom}, \term{oneof}{ListOfAtoms},
        \const{integer}, \const{float} and \const{term}.  The default
        is determined from the initial value.  Note that \const{term}
        restricts the term to be ground.

	\termitem{keep}{+Boolean}
	If \const{true}, do not modify the flag if it already exists.
	Otherwise (default), this predicate behaves as set_prolog_flag/2
	if the flag already exists.

        If the flag has a value, but this value is incompatible with the
        specified type, a warning is printed and the flag gets the
        value and type specified by this call to create_prolog_flag/3.

        \termitem{warn_not_accessed}{+Boolean}
        If \const{true} and the flag is never read using
        current_prolog_flag/2, print a warning.  This option is used
        for options set using the commandline option \verb$-D<flag>[=<value>]$.
    \end{description}
\end{description}


\section{An overview of hook predicates}	\label{sec:hooks}

\index{hooks}
SWI-Prolog provides a large number of hooks, mainly to control handling
messages, debugging, startup, shut-down, macro-expansion, etc.  Below
is a summary of all defined hooks with an indication of their
portability.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [portray/1]
Hook into write_term/3 to alter the way terms are printed (ISO).
    \item [message_hook/3]
Hook into print_message/2 to alter the way system messages are printed
(Quintus/SICStus).
    \item [message_property/2]
Hook into print_message/2 that defines prefix, output stream, color,
etc.
    \item [message_prefix_hook/2]
Hook into print_message/2 to add additional prefixes to the message such
as the time and thread.
    \item [library_directory/1]
Hook into absolute_file_name/3 to define new library directories
(most Prolog systems).
    \item [file_search_path/2]
Hook into absolute_file_name/3 to define new search paths
(Quintus/SICStus).
    \item [term_expansion/2]
Hook into load_files/2 to modify read terms before they are compiled
(macro-processing) (most Prolog systems).
    \item [goal_expansion/2]
Same as term_expansion/2 for individual goals (SICStus).
    \item [prolog_load_file/2]
Hook into load_files/2 to load other data formats for Prolog sources
from `non-file' resources.  The load_files/2 predicate is the ancestor
of consult/1, use_module/1, etc.
    \item [prolog_edit:locate/3]
Hook into edit/1 to locate objects (SWI).
    \item [prolog_edit:edit_source/1]
Hook into edit/1 to call an internal editor (SWI).
    \item [prolog_edit:edit_command/2]
Hook into edit/1 to define the external editor to use (SWI).
    \item [prolog_list_goal/1]
Hook into the tracer to list the code associated to a particular goal
(SWI).
    \item [prolog_trace_interception/4]
Hook into the tracer to handle trace events (SWI).
    \item [prolog:debug_control_hook/1]
Hook in spy/1, nospy/1, nospyall/0 and debugging/0 to extend these
control predicates to higher-level libraries.
    \item [prolog:help_hook/1]
Hook in help/0, help/1 and apropos/1 to extend the help system.
    \item [resource/3]
Define a new resource (not really a hook, but similar) (SWI).
    \item [exception/3]
Old attempt to a generic hook mechanism.  Handles undefined predicates (SWI).
    \item [attr_unify_hook/2]
Unification hook for attributed variables. Can be defined in any
module.  See \secref{attvar} for details.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Automatic loading of libraries}	\label{sec:autoload}

If ---at runtime--- an undefined predicate is trapped, the system will
first try to import the predicate from the module's default module (see
\secref{importmodule}. If this fails the \jargon{auto loader} is
activated.\footnote{Actually, the hook user:exception/3 is called; only
if this hook fails it calls the autoloader.} On first activation an
index to all library files in all library directories is loaded in core
(see library_directory/1, file_search_path/2 and
reload_library_index/0). If the undefined predicate can be located in
one of the libraries, that library file is automatically loaded and the
call to the (previously undefined) predicate is restarted. By default
this mechanism loads the file silently. The current_prolog_flag/2
key \prologflag{verbose_autoload} is provided to get verbose loading. The
Prolog flag \prologflag{autoload} can be used to enable/disable the
autoload system.  A more controlled form of autoloading as well as
lazy loading application modules is provided by autoload/[1,2].

Autoloading only handles (library) source files that use the module
mechanism described in \chapref{modules}.  The files are loaded
with use_module/2 and only the trapped undefined predicate is imported
into the module where the undefined predicate was called.  Each library
directory must hold a file \file{INDEX.pl} that contains an index to all
library files in the directory.  This file consists of lines of the
following format:

\begin{code}
index(Name, Arity, Module, File).
\end{code}

The predicate make/0 updates the autoload index. It searches for all
library directories (see library_directory/1 and file_search_path/2)
holding the file \file{MKINDEX.pl} or \file{INDEX.pl}. If the current
user can write or create the file \file{INDEX.pl} and it does not exist
or is older than the directory or one of its files, the index for this
directory is updated. If the file \file{MKINDEX.pl} exists, updating is
achieved by loading this file, normally containing a directive calling
make_library_index/2. Otherwise make_library_index/1 is called, creating
an index for all \file{*.pl} files containing a module.

Below is an example creating an indexed library directory.

\begin{code}
% mkdir ~/${XDG_DATA_HOME-.config}/swi-prolog/lib
% cd ~/${XDG_DATA_HOME-.config}/swi-prolog/lib
% swipl -g 'make_library_index(.)' -t halt
\end{code}

If there is more than one library file containing the desired predicate,
the following search schema is followed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If there is a library file that defines the module in which
        the undefined predicate is trapped, this file is used.
  \item Otherwise library files are considered in the order they appear
        in the library_directory/1 predicate and within the directory
        alphabetically.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{autoload_path}{1}{+DirAlias}
Add \arg{DirAlias} to the libraries that are  used by the autoloader. This
extends the search  path  \const{autoload}   and  reloads  the library
index.  For example:

\begin{code}
:- autoload_path(library(http)).
\end{code}

If this call appears as a directive, it is term-expanded into a clause
for user:file_search_path/2 and a directive calling
reload_library_index/0. This keeps source information and allows for
removing this directive.

    \predicate{make_library_index}{1}{+Directory}
Create an index for this directory.  The index is written to the file
'INDEX.pl' in the specified directory.  Fails with a warning if the
directory does not exist or is write protected.

    \predicate{make_library_index}{2}{+Directory, +ListOfPatterns}
Normally used in \file{MKINDEX.pl}, this predicate creates \file{INDEX.pl}
for \arg{Directory}, indexing all files that match one of the file patterns
in \arg{ListOfPatterns}.

Sometimes library packages consist of one public load file and a number
of files used by this load file, exporting predicates that should not be
used directly by the end user. Such a library can be placed in a
sub-directory of the library and the files containing public
functionality can be added to the index of the library.  As an
example we give the XPCE library's \file{MKINDEX.pl}, including the
public functionality of \file{trace/browse.pl} to the autoloadable
predicates for the XPCE package.

\begin{code}
:- prolog_load_context(directory, Dir),
   make_library_index(Dir,
		      [ '*.pl',
			'trace/browse.pl',
			'swi/*.pl'
		      ]).
\end{code}

    \predicate{reload_library_index}{0}{}
Force reloading the index after modifying the set of library directories
by changing the rules for library_directory/1, file_search_path/2,
adding or deleting \file{INDEX.pl} files. This predicate does \emph{not}
update the \file{INDEX.pl} files.  Check make_library_index/[1,2] and
make/0 for updating the index files.

Normally, the index is reloaded automatically if a predicate cannot be
found in the index and the set of library directories has changed. Using
reload_library_index/0 is necessary if directories are removed or the
order of the library directories is changed.
\end{description}

When creating an executable using either qsave_program/2 or the
\cmdlineoption{-c} command line options, it is necessary to load
all predicates that would normally be autoloaded explicitly.  This
is discussed in \secref{runtime}.  See autoload_all/0.


\section{The SWI-Prolog syntax}			\label{sec:syntax}

SWI-Prolog syntax is close to ISO-Prolog standard syntax, which is based
on the Edinburgh Prolog syntax. A formal description can be found in the
ISO standard document. For an informal introduction we refer to Prolog
text books (see \secref{intro}) and
\href{http://www.swi-prolog.org/Links.html}{online tutorials}. In
addition to the differences from the ISO standard documented here,
SWI-Prolog offers several extensions, some of which also extend the
syntax. See \secref{extensions} for more information.


\subsection{ISO Syntax Support}			\label{sec:isosyntax}

This section lists various extensions w.r.t.\ the ISO Prolog syntax.

\subsubsection{Processor Character Set}		\label{sec:processorcharset}

\index{ISO Latin 1}\index{character set}%
The processor character set specifies the class of each character used
for parsing Prolog source text.  Character classification is fixed to
\href{http://www.unicode.org/}{Unicode}.  See also \secref{widechars}.

\subsubsection{Nested comments}			\label{sec:nestedcomments}

SWI-Prolog allows for nesting \exam{/* \ldots */} comments. Where the
ISO standard accepts \exam{/* \ldots /* \ldots */} as a comment,
SWI-Prolog will search for a terminating \exam{*/}. This is useful if
some code with \exam{/* \ldots */} comment statements in it should be
commented out. This modification also avoids unintended commenting in
the example below, where the closing \exam{*/} of the first comment has
been forgotten.\footnote{Recent copies of GCC give a style warning if
\exam{/*} is encountered in a comment, which suggests that this
problem has been recognised more widely.}

\begin{code}
/* comment

code

/* second comment */

code

\end{code}

\subsubsection{Character Escape Syntax}		\label{sec:charescapes}

Within quoted atoms (using single quotes: \exam{'<atom>'}) special
characters are represented using escape sequences. An escape sequence is
led in by the backslash (\chr{\}) character. The list of escape
sequences is compatible with the ISO standard but contains some
extensions, and the interpretation of numerically specified characters
is slightly more flexible to improve compatibility.  Undefined escape
characters raise a \const{syntax_error} exception.\footnote{Up to
SWI-Prolog~6.1.9, undefined escape characters were copied verbatim,
i.e., removing the backslash.}

\begin{description}
    \escapeitem{a}
Alert character.  Normally the ASCII character 7 (beep).
    \escapeitem{b}
Backspace character.
    \escapeitem{c}
No output.  All input characters up to but not including the first
non-layout character are skipped.  This allows for the specification
of pretty-looking long lines.  Not supported by ISO.  Example:
\begin{code}
format('This is a long line that looks better if it was \c
       split across multiple physical lines in the input')
\end{code}
    \escapeitem{\bnfmeta{{\sc NEWLINE}}}
When in ISO mode (see the Prolog flag \prologflag{iso}), only skip this
sequence. In native mode, white space that follows the newline is
skipped as well and a warning is printed, indicating that this construct
is deprecated and advising to use \verb$\c$. We advise using \verb$\c$
or putting the layout \emph{before} the \chr{\}, as shown below. Using
\verb$\c$ is supported by various other Prolog implementations and will
remain supported by SWI-Prolog. The style shown below is the most
compatible solution.\footnote{Future versions will interpret
\chr{\}<return> according to ISO.}

\begin{code}
format('This is a long line that looks better if it was \
split across multiple physical lines in the input')
\end{code}

instead of

\begin{code}
format('This is a long line that looks better if it was\
 split across multiple physical lines in the input')
\end{code}

Note that SWI-Prolog also allows unescaped newlines to appear in quoted
material.  This is not allowed by the ISO standard, but used to be
common practice before.
    \escapeitem{e}
Escape character (\textsc{ASCII} 27). Not ISO, but widely supported.
    \escapeitem{f}
Form-feed character.
    \escapeitem{n}
Next-line character.
    \escapeitem{r}
Carriage-return only (i.e., go back to the start of the line).
    \escapeitem{s}
Space character.  Intended to allow writing \verb$0'\s$
to get the character code of the space character. Not ISO.
    \escapeitem{t}
Horizontal tab character.
    \escapeitem{v}
Vertical tab character (\textsc{ASCII} 11).
    \escapeitem{xXX..\}
Hexadecimal specification of a character. The closing \verb$\$ is
obligatory according to the ISO standard, but optional in SWI-Prolog to
enhance compatibility with the older Edinburgh standard. The code
\verb$\xa\3$ emits the character 10 (hexadecimal `a') followed by `3'.
Characters specified this way are interpreted as Unicode characters. See
also \verb$\u$.
    \escapeitem{uXXXX}
Unicode character specification where the character is specified using
\emph{exactly} 4 hexadecimal digits.  This is an extension to the ISO
standard, fixing two problems.  First, where \verb$\x$ defines
a numeric character code, it doesn't specify the character set in which
the character should be interpreted.  Second, it is not needed to
use the idiosyncratic closing \chr{\} ISO Prolog syntax.
    \escapeitem{UXXXXXXXX}
Same as \verb$\uXXXX$, but using 8 digits to cover the whole Unicode
set.
    \escapeitem{40}
Octal character specification.  The rules and remarks for hexadecimal
specifications apply to octal specifications as well.
    \escapeitem{\}
Escapes the backslash itself.  Thus, \verb$'\\'$ is an atom
consisting of a single \chr{\}.
    \escapeitem{'}
Single quote. Note that \verb$'\''$ and \verb$''''$ both describe
the atom with a single~\chr{'}, i.e., \verb$'\'' == ''''$ is true.
    \escapeitem{"}
Double quote.
    \escapeitem{`}
Back quote.
\end{description}

Character escaping is only available if
\exam{current_prolog_flag(character_escapes, true)} is active (default).
See current_prolog_flag/2. Character escapes conflict with writef/2 in
two ways: \verb$\40$ is interpreted as decimal 40 by writef/2, but as
octal 40 (decimal 32) by \verb$read$. Also, the writef/2 sequence
\fmtseq{\l} is illegal. It is advised to use the more widely supported
format/[2,3] predicate instead. If you insist upon using writef/2,
either switch \prologflag{character_escapes} to \const{false}, or use
double \fmtseq{\\}, as in \verb$writef('\\l')$.

\subsubsection{Syntax for non-decimal numbers}	\label{sec:nondecsyntax}

SWI-Prolog implements both Edinburgh and ISO representations for
non-decimal numbers. According to Edinburgh syntax, such numbers are
written as \exam{<radix>'<number>}, where <radix> is a number between 2
and 36. ISO defines binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers using
\exam{0{\em [bxo]}<number>}. For example: \verb$A is 0b100 \/ 0xf00$ is
a valid expression. Such numbers are always unsigned.

\subsubsection{Using digit groups in large integers}
\label{sec:digitgroupsyntax}

SWI-Prolog supports splitting long integers into \jargon{digit groups}.
Digit groups can be separated with the sequence \bnfmeta{underscore},
\bnfmeta{optional white space}. If the \bnfmeta{radix} is 10 or lower,
they may also be separated with exactly one space. The following all
express the integer 1~million:

\begin{code}
1_000_000
1 000 000
1_000_/*more*/000
\end{code}

Integers can be printed using this notation with format/2, using the
\verb$~I$ format specifier.  For example:

\begin{code}
?- format('~I', [1000000]).
1_000_000
\end{code}

The current syntax has been proposed by Ulrich Neumerkel on the
SWI-Prolog mailinglist.


\subsubsection{Rational number syntax}
\label{sec:syntax-rational-numbers}

As of version 8.1.22, SWI-Prolog supports rational numbers as a primary
citizen atomic data type if SWI-Prolog is compiled with the GMP library.
This can be tested using the \prologflag{bounded} Prolog flag. An atomic
type also requires a syntax. Unfortunately there are few options for
adding rational numbers without breaking the ISO
standard.\footnote{ECLiPSe uses \arg{numerator}_\arg{denominator}. This
syntax conflicts with SWI-Prolog digit groups (see
\secref{digitgroupsyntax}) and does not have a recognised link to
rational numbers. The notation \exam{1/3r} and \exam{1/3R} have also
been proposed. The \exam{1/3r} is compatible to Ruby, but is hard to
parse due to the required look-ahead and not very natural. See also
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_data_type}.}

ECLiPSe and SWI-Prolog have agreed to define the canonical syntax for
rational numbers to be e.g., \exam{1r3}. In addition, ECLiPSe accepts
\exam{1_3} and SWI-Prolog can be asked to accept \exam{1/3} using the
module sensitive Prolog flag \prologflag{rational_syntax}, which has the
values below. Note that write_canonical/1 always uses the compatible
\exam{1r3} syntax.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{natural}{}
This is the default mode where we ignore the ambiguity issue and follow
the most natural <integer>/<nonneg> alternative. Here, <integer> follows
the normal rules for Prolog decimal integers and <nonneg> does the same,
but does not allows for a sign. Note that the parser translates a
rational number to its canonical form which implies there are no common
divisors in the resulting numerator and denominator. Examples of ration
numbers are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1/2		 & 1/2      \\
2/4              & 1/2      \\
1 000 000/33 000 & 1000/33  \\
-3/5		 & -3/5     \\
\end{tabular}

We expect very few programs to have text parsed into a rational number
while a term was expected. Note that for rationals appearing in an
arithmetic expression the only difference is that evaluation moves from
runtime to compiletime. The utility list_rationals/0 may be used on a
loaded program to check whether the program contains rational numbers
inside clauses and thus may be subject to compatibility issues. If a
term is intended this can be written as \verb$/(1,2)$, \verb$(1)/2$,
\verb$1 / 2$ or some variation thereof.

    \termitem{compatibility}{}
Read and write rational numbers as e.g., \exam{1r3}. In other words,
this adheres to the same rules as \const{natural} above, but using the
`\chr{r}' instead of `\chr{/}'. Note that this may conflict with
traditional Prolog as `\const{r}' can be defined as an infix operator.
The same argument holds for \exam{0x23} and similar syntax for numbers
that are part of the ISO standard.
\end{description}

While the syntax is controlled by the flag \prologflag{rational_syntax},
behavior on integer division and exponentiation is controlled by the
flag \prologflag{prefer_rationals}. See section \secref{rational} for
arithmetic on rational numbers.


\subsubsection{NaN and Infinity floats and their syntax}
\label{sec:floatsyntax}

SWI-Prolog supports reading and printing `special' floating point values
according to
\href{http://eclipseclp.org/Specs/core_update_float.html}{Proposal for
Prolog Standard core update wrt floating point arithmetic} by Joachim
Schimpf and available in ECLiPSe Prolog. In particular,

\begin{itemize}
    \item Infinity is printed as \verb$1.0Inf$ or \verb$-1.0Inf$.  Any
    sequence matching the regular expression \verb$[+-]?\sd+[.]\sd+Inf$
    is mapped to plus or minus infinity.

    \item \const{NaN} (Not a Number) is printed as \verb$1.xxxNaN$, where
    \textit{1.xxx} is the float after replacing the exponent by `1'.
    Such numbers are read, resulting in the same \const{NaN}. The
    \const{NaN} constant can also be produced using the function
    \funcref{nan}{0}, e.g.,

\begin{code}
?- A is nan.
A = 1.5NaN.
\end{code}
\end{itemize}

By default SWI-Prolog arithmetic (see \secref{arith}) follows the ISO
standard with describes that floating point operations either produce a
\jargon{normal} floating point number or raise an exception.
\secref{ieee-float} describes the Prolog flags that can be used to
support the IEEE special float values. The ability to create, read and
write such values facilitates the exchange of data with languages that
can represent the full range of IEEE doubles.

\subsubsection{Force only underscore to introduce a variable}
\label{sec:varprefix}

According to the ISO standard and most Prolog systems, identifiers that
start with an uppercase letter or an underscore are variables. In the
past, \jargon{Prolog by BIM} provided an alternative syntax, where only
the underscore (\chr{_}) introduces a variable. As of SWI-Prolog 7.3.27
SWI-Prolog supports this alternative syntax, controlled by the Prolog
flag \prologflag{var_prefix}. As the \prologflag{character_escapes}
flag, this flag is maintained per module, where the default is
\const{false}, supporting standard syntax.

Having only the underscore introduce a variable is particularly useful
if code contains identifiers for case sensitive external languages.
Examples are the RDF library where code frequently specifies property
and class names\footnote{Samer Abdallah suggested this feature based on
experience with non-Prolog users using the RDF library.} and the R
interface for specifying functions or variables that start with an
uppercase character. Lexical databases where part of the terms start with
an uppercase letter is another category were the readability of the code
improves using this option.


\subsubsection{Unicode Prolog source}		\label{sec:unicodesyntax}

The ISO standard specifies the Prolog syntax in ASCII characters. As
SWI-Prolog supports Unicode in source files we must extend the syntax.
This section describes the implication for the source files, while
writing international source files is described in \secref{intsrcfile}.

The SWI-Prolog Unicode character classification is currently based on
version 14.0.0 of the Unicode standard. Please note that char_type/2
and friends, intended to be used with all text except Prolog source
code, is based on the C library locale-based classification routines.


\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Quoted atoms and strings]
Any character of any script can be used in quoted atoms and strings. The
escape sequences \verb$\uXXXX$ and \verb$\UXXXXXXXX$ (see
\secref{charescapes}) were introduced to specify Unicode code points in
ASCII files.

    \item [Atoms and Variables]
We handle them in one item as they are closely related.  The Unicode
standard defines a syntax for identifiers in computer languages.%
	\footnote{\url{http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/}}
In this syntax identifiers start with \const{ID_Start} followed by a
sequence of \const{ID_Continue} codes. Such sequences are handled as a
single token in SWI-Prolog. The token is a \emph{variable} iff it starts
with an uppercase character or an underscore (\chr{_}). Otherwise it is
an atom.  Note that many languages do not have the notion of
character case.  In such languages variables \emph{must} be written as
\verb$_name$.

    \item [Numbers]

Decimal number characters (Nd) are accepted to form numbers, regardless
of the Unicode block in which they appear. Currently this is supported
for integers, rational numbers (see \secref{syntax-rational-numbers})
and floating point numbers. In any number, \emph{all} digits must come
from the same block, i.e., if the nominator of a rational is uses
Indian script, so must the denominator.  All special characters such
as the sign, rational separator, floating point \chr{.}, and floating
point exponent must use their usual ASCII character.

    \item [White space]
All characters marked as separators (Z*) in the Unicode tables are
handled as layout characters.

    \item [Control and unassigned characters]
Control and unassigned (C*) characters produce a syntax error if
encountered outside quoted atoms/strings and outside comments. Quoted
writing (e.g., writeq/1) of an atom or string that contains one of these
characters causes the atom or string to be quoted and the control or
unassigned characters to be written using an escape sequence.  See
\secref{charescapes}.

    \item [Other characters]
The first 128 characters follow the ISO Prolog standard.  Unicode symbol
and punctuation characters (general category S* and P*) act as glueing
symbol characters (i.e., just like \const{==}: an unquoted sequence of
symbol characters are combined into an atom).

Other characters (this is mainly \const{No}: \textit{a numeric character
of other type}) are currently handled as `solo'.
\end{itemlist}


\subsubsection{Singleton variable checking}	\label{sec:singleton}

\index{singleton,variable}\index{anonymous,variable}%
A \jargon{singleton variable} is a variable that appears only one time
in a clause. It can always be replaced by \verb$_$, the
\jargon{anonymous} variable. In some cases, however, people prefer to give
the variable a name. As mistyping a variable is a common mistake, Prolog
systems generally give a warning (controlled by style_check/1) if a
variable is used only once. The system can be informed that a variable is
meant to appear once by \emph{starting} it with an underscore, e.g.,
\verb$_Name$. Please note that any variable, except plain \verb$_$,
shares with variables of the same name. The term \verb$t(_X, _X)$ is
equivalent to \verb$t(X, X)$, which is \emph{different} from
\verb$t(_, _)$.

As Unicode requires variables to start with an underscore in many
languages, this schema has been extended.%
	\footnote{After a proposal by Richard O'Keefe.}
First we define the two classes of named variables.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Named singleton variables]
Named singletons start with a double underscore (\verb$__$) or a single
underscore followed by an uppercase letter,  e.g., \verb$__var$ or
\verb$_Var$.

    \item [Normal variables]
All other variables are `normal' variables. Note this makes \verb$_var$
a normal variable.%
	\footnote{Some Prolog dialects write variables this way.}
\end{itemlist}

Any normal variable appearing exactly once in the clause \emph{and}
any named singleton variables appearing more than once are reported.
Below are some examples with warnings in the right column.  Singleton
messages can be suppressed using the style_check/1 directive.

Finally, variables named \verb$_<digit>$ are never subject to style
checking.  These variable names are emitted by write/1 and friends.
This exception can also be used to pass singletons to debug/3.
Passing singletons to debug/3 is otherwise problematic as using a
normal variable results in a singleton warning when optimization
removes the debug/3 statement while using a named anonymous variable
results in a \jargon{multiton} warning.  For example:

\begin{code}
p(X) :-
    q(X,_0Y),
    debug(demo, 'q/2 says ~p', [_0Y]).
\end{code}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
test(_).	& \\
test(_a).	& Singleton variables: [_a] \\
test(A).	& Singleton variables: [A] \\
test(_12).	& \\
test(_A).	& \\
test(__a).	& \\
test(_, _).	& \\
test(_a, _a).	& \\
test(__a, __a). & Singleton-marked variables appearing more than once: [__a] \\
test(_A, _A).	& Singleton-marked variables appearing more than once: [_A] \\
test(A, A).	& \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Semantic singletons}

Starting with version 6.5.1, SWI-Prolog has \jargon{syntactic
singletons} and \jargon{semantic singletons}. The first are checked by
read_clause/3 (and read_term/3 using the option
\term{singletons}{warning}). The latter are generated by the compiler
for variables that appear alone in a \jargon{branch}. For example, in
the code below the variable \arg{X} is not a \emph{syntactic} singleton,
but the variable \arg{X} does not communicate any bindings and replacing
\arg{X} with \arg{_} does not change the semantics.

\begin{code}
test :-
	(   test_1(X)
	;   test_2(X)
	).
\end{code}


\section{Rational trees (cyclic terms)}		\label{sec:cyclic}

\index{rational trees}%
\index{infinite trees}\index{cyclic terms}\index{terms,cyclic}%

SWI-Prolog supports rational trees, also known as cyclic terms.
`Supports' is so defined that most relevant built-in predicates terminate
when faced with rational trees.  Almost all SWI-Prolog's built-in term
manipulation predicates process terms in a time that is linear to the
amount of memory used to represent the term on the stack.  The following
set of predicates safely handles rational trees:
%
\predref{=..}{2},
\predref{==}{2},
\predref{=@=}{2},
\predref{=}{2},
\predref{@<}{2},
\predref{@=<}{2},
\predref{@>=}{2},
\predref{@>}{2},
\predref{\==}{2},
\predref{\=@=}{2},
\predref{\=}{2},
acyclic_term/1,
bagof/3,
compare/3,
copy_term/2,
cyclic_term/1,
dif/2,
duplicate_term/2,
findall/3,
ground/1,
term_hash/2,
numbervars/3,
numbervars/4,
recorda/3,
recordz/3,
setof/3,
subsumes_term/2,
term_variables/2,
throw/1,
unify_with_occurs_check/2,
unifiable/3,
when/2,
write/1 (and related predicates)
.

In addition, some built-ins recognise rational trees and raise an
appropriate exception. Arithmetic evaluation belongs to this group. The
compiler (asserta/1, etc.) also raises an exception. Future versions may
support rational trees. Predicates that could provide meaningful
processing of rational trees raise a \const{representation_error}.
Predicates for which rational trees have no meaningful interpretation
raise a \const{type_error}.  For example:

\begin{code}
1 ?- A = f(A), asserta(a(A)).
ERROR: asserta/1: Cannot represent due to `cyclic_term'
2 ?- A = 1+A, B is A.
ERROR: is/2: Type error: `expression' expected, found
	     `@(S_1,[S_1=1+S_1])' (cyclic term)
\end{code}


\section{Just-in-time clause indexing}		\label{sec:jitindex}

\index{jitindex}\index{indexing,jiti}%
SWI-Prolog provides `just-in-time' indexing over multiple
arguments. `Just-in-time' means that clause indexes are not built by the
compiler (or asserta/1 for dynamic predicates), but on the first call to
such a predicate where an index might help (i.e., a call where at least
one argument is instantiated). This section describes the rules used by
the indexing logic. Note that this logic is not `set in stone'. The
indexing capabilities of the system will change. Although this
inevitably leads to some regressing on some particular use cases, we
strive to avoid significant slowdowns.

The list below describes the clause selection process for various
predicates and calls.  The alternatives are considered in the order
they are presented.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Special purpose code]
Currently two special cases are recognised by the compiler: static code
with exactly one clause and static code with two clauses, one where some
argument is the empty list (\verb$[]$) and one where the same argument
is a non-empty list (\verb$[_|_]$). Note that if this argument is an
\jargon{output argument}, semantics are preserved, but efficiency
suffers slightly. This slow-down can be avoided using mode/1 to declare
the argument as \chr{-}.\footnote{Up to version 9.3.18, only the first
argument was considered.}

    \item [Linear scan on primary index argument]
The principal clause list maintains a \jargon{key}, normally for the
first argument. An indexing key is either a constant or a functor
(name/arity reference). Calls with an instantiated primary index
argument and less than 10 clauses perform a linear scan for a possible
matching clause using this index key. If the result is deterministic it
is used. Otherwise the system looks for better indexes.\footnote{Up to
7.7.2 this result was used also when non-deterministic.}.  The primary
index argument is the first argument for which at least one of the
clauses has an indexable (nonvar) value for that argument.\footnote{Up
to version 9.3.18, the primary index was fixed to the first argument.}

    \item [Hash lookup]
If none of the above applies, the system considers the available hash
tables for which the corresponding argument is instantiated. If a table
is found with acceptable characteristics, it is used. Otherwise it
assesses the clauses for all instantiated arguments and selects the best
candidate for creating a new hash table. If there is no single argument
that provides an acceptable hash quality it will search for a
combination of arguments.\footnote{The last step was added in SWI-Prolog
7.5.8.}  Searching for index candidates is only performed on the first
254 arguments.

If a single-argument index contains multiple compound terms with the
same name and arity and at least one non-variable argument, a
\jargon{list index} is created. A subsequent query where this argument
is bound to a compound causes jiti indexing to be applied
\jargon{recursively} on the arguments of the term.  This is called
\jargon{deep indexing}.\footnote{Deep indexing was added in version
7.7.4.}  See also \secref{deep-indexing}

Clauses that have a variable at an otherwise indexable argument must be
linked into all hash buckets. Currently, predicates that have more than
10\% such clauses for a specific argument are not considered for
indexing on that argument.

Disregarding variables, the suitability of an argument for hashing is
expressed as the number of unique indexable values divided by the
standard deviation of the number of duplicate values for each value plus
one.\footnote{Earlier versions simply used the number of unique values,
but poor distribution of values makes a table less suitable.  This was
analysed by Fabien Noth and G\"unter Kniesel.}

The indexes of dynamic predicates are deleted if the number of clauses
is doubled since its creation or reduced below 1/4th. The JIT approach
will recreate a suitable index on the next call. Indexes of running
predicates cannot be deleted. They are added to a `removed index list'
associated to the predicate. Outdated indexes of predicates are
reclaimed by garbage_collect_clauses/0.  The clause garbage collector
is scheduled automatically, based on time and space based heuristics.
See garbage_collect_clauses/0 for details.
\end{itemlist}

The library \pllib{prolog_jiti} provides jiti_list/0,1 to list the
characteristics of all or some of the created hash tables.

\paragraph{Dynamic predicates} are indexed using the same rules as
static predicates, except that the \jargon{special purpose} schemes are
never applied. In addition, the JITI index is discarded if the number of
clauses has doubled since the predicate was last assessed or shrinks
below one fourth. A subsequent call reassesses the statistics of the
dynamic predicate and, when applicable, creates a new index.

Jit indexing is controlled by a set of Prolog flags whose names starts
with \const{ci_}, e.g., \prologflag{ci_min_speedup}. See
current_prolog_flag/2.

\subsection{Deep indexing}
\label{sec:deep-indexing}

\index{indexing,deep}%
As introduced in \secref{jitindex}, \jargon{deep indexing} creates hash
tables distinguish clauses that share a compound with the same name and
arity. Deep indexes allow for efficient lookup of arbitrary terms.
Without it is advised to \jargon{flatten} the term, i.e., turn
\term{F}{X} into two arguments for the fact, one argument denoting the
functor \arg{F} and the second the argument {X}. This works fine as long
as the arity of the each of the terms is the same. Alternatively we can
use term_hash/2 or term_hash/4 to add a column holding the hash of the
term. That approach can deal with arbitrary arities, but requires us to
know that the term is ground (term_hash/2) or up to which depth we get
sufficient selectivity (term_hash/4).

Deep indexing does not require this knowledge and leads to efficient
lookup regardless of the instantiation of the query and term.  The
current version does come with some limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The decision which index to use is taken independently
    at each level.  Future versions may be smarter on this.
    \item Deep indexing only applies to a \emph{single argument}
    indexes (on any argument).
    \item Currently, the depth of indexing is limited to 7 levels.
\end{itemize}

\index{indexing,DCG}\index{DCG,indexing}%
Note that, when compiling DCGs (see \secref{DCG}) and the first body
term is a \jargon{literal}, it is included into the clause head. See
for example the grammar and its plain Prolog representation below.

\begin{code}
det(det(a), sg)  --> "a".
det(det(an), pl) --> "an".
det(det(the), _) --> "the".
\end{code}

\begin{code}
?- listing(det).
det(det(a), sg, [97|A], A).
det(det(an), pl, [97, 110|A], A).
det(det(the), _, [116, 104, 101|A], A).
\end{code}

Deep argument indexing will create indexes for the 3rd list argument,
providing speedup and making clause selection deterministic if all rules
start with a literal and all literals are unique in the first 6
elements. Note that deep index creation stops as soon as a deterministic
choice can be made or there are no two clauses that have the same
name/arity combination.

\subsection{Future directions}
\label{sec:indexfut}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
The `special cases' can be extended.  This is notably attractive for
static predicates with a relatively small number of clauses where a
hash lookup is too costly.

    \item
Create an efficient decision diagram for selecting between low numbers
of static clauses.

    \item
Implement a better judgements for selecting between deep and plain
indexes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indexing for body code}
\label{sec:indexbody}

The current SWI-Prolog versions only consider the head for generating
clause indexing. This would make it impossible to examine a head
argument and pass the argument in the body without copying the argument.
Consider the two clauses below. Both have equal semantics under Prolog.
The first version would loose clause indexing while the second creates a
copy of the \funcref{f}{1} argument. Neither is desirable.

\begin{code}
p(X) :- X = f(I), integer(I), q(X).
p(f(I)) :- integer(I), q(f(X)).
\end{code}

As of SWI-Prolog 8.3.21, unifications against head arguments that happen
before anything else in the body are compiled special. Effectively, the
term unified too is moved into the head (providing indexing) and places
where this term is used simply use the corresponding argument. The
explicit unification is removed. Decompilation (clause/2) reverses this
process, but may not produce exactly the same term.  The re-inserted
unifications are ordered according to the argument position and the
variable is always on the left hand of the \predref{=}{2}.  Thus,

\begin{code}
p(X,Y) :- f(_) = Y, X = g(_), q(X,Y).
\end{code}

Is decompiled into the following equivalent clause.

\begin{code}
p(X,Y) :- X = g(_), Y = f(_), q(X,Y).
\end{code}

Additional notes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item This transformation is only performed on \emph{static} code.
    \item The unifications must \emph{immediately} follow the head in
    a \jargon{conjunction}.
    \item As sole exception, calls to true/0 are skipped.  This allows
    goal_expansion/2 to convert goals to \const{true} while preserving
    this optimization.
    \item If the head argument is not used the body unification is
    still moved into the head.  The decompiler does not inverse the
    process in that case.  Thus, \exam{p(X) :- X = a.} is fully
    equivalent to \exam{p(a).}
    \item Currently this optimisation is enabled regardless of the
    Prolog flag \prologflag{optimise}.  As this optimization harms
    source-level debugging, this may not be desirable.  On the other
    hand we do not want determinism to depend on optimization while
    this optimization affects determinism.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Indexing and portability}
\label{sec:indexport}

The base-line functionality of Prolog implementations provides indexing
on constants and functor (name/arity) on the first argument. This must
be your assumption if wide portability of your program is important.
This can typically be achieved by exploiting term_hash/2 or term_hash/4
and/or maintaining multiple copies of a predicate with reordered
arguments and wrappers that update all implementations (assert/retract)
and selects the appropriate implementation (query).

YAP provides full JIT indexing, including indexing arguments of compound
terms. YAP's indexing has been the inspiration for enhancing
SWI-Prolog's indexing capabilities.


\section{Wide character support}		\label{sec:widechars}

\index{UTF-8}\index{UTF-16}\index{Unicode}\index{UCS}\index{internationalization}%
SWI-Prolog represents characters using
\href{https://home.unicode.org}{Unicode}. Unicode defines \jargon{code
points} in the range $0\ldots{}0x10FFFF$. These code points represent
virtually any character in any language. In addition, the Unicode
standard defines character classes (letter, digit, punctuation, etc.),
case conversion and much more. Unicode is a super set of ISO 8859-1 (ISO
Latin-1), which is a superset of US-ASCII.

SWI-Prolog has two representations for atoms and string objects (see
\secref{string}). If the text fits in ISO Latin-1, it is represented as
an array of 8-bit characters. Otherwise the text is represented as an
array of \ctype{wchar_t} characters. On virtually all systems except for
MS-Windows, \ctype{wchar_t} is a 32-bit unsigned integer and thus
capable of representing all Unicode code points. On MS-Windows
\ctype{wchar_t} is a 16-bit unsigned integer and thus only capable of
representing the code points $0\ldots{}0xFFFF$. As of SWI-Prolog version
8.5.14, the \ctype{wchar_t} is (on Windows) interpreted as a UTF-16
string. The UTF-16 encoding uses \jargon{surrogate pairs} to represent
the code points $0x10000\ldots{}0x10FFFF$ as two \jargon{code units} in
the $0xD800\ldots{}0xDFFF$.  As Unicode \jargon{code points}, this range
is \jargon{unassigned}.   For consistency, SWI-Prolog does not accept
integers in the surrogate pair range as valid code points, e.g.

\begin{code}
?- char_code(X, 0xD800).
ERROR: Type error: `character_code' expected, found `55296' (an integer)
\end{code}

The internal character representation is completely transparent to the
Prolog user. Users of the foreign language interface as described in
\chapref{foreign} sometimes need to be aware of these issues though.

Character coding comes into view when characters of strings need to be
read from or written to file or when they have to be communicated to
other software components using the foreign language interface. In this
section we only deal with I/O through streams, which includes file I/O
as well as I/O through network sockets.


\subsection{Wide character encodings on streams} \label{sec:encoding}

Although characters are uniquely coded using the Unicode standard
internally, streams and files are byte (8-bit) oriented and there are a
variety of ways to represent the larger Unicode codes in an 8-bit octet
stream. The most popular one, especially in the context of the web, is
UTF-8. Bytes 0~\ldots{}~127 represent simply the corresponding US-ASCII
character, while bytes 128~\ldots{}~255 are used for multi-byte encoding
of characters placed higher in the Unicode space. Especially on MS-Windows
the 16-bit UTF-16 standard, represented by pairs of bytes, is also
popular.

Prolog I/O streams have a property called \jargon{encoding} which
specifies the used encoding that influences get_code/2 and put_code/2 as
well as all the other text I/O predicates.

The default encoding for files is derived from the Prolog flag
\prologflag{encoding}, which is initialised from
\exam{setlocale(LC_CTYPE, NULL)} to one of \const{text}, \const{utf8} or
\const{iso_latin_1}. One of the latter two is used if the encoding name
is recognized, while \const{text} is used as default. Using
\const{text}, the translation is left to the wide-character functions of
the C library.\footnote{The Prolog native UTF-8 mode is considerably
faster than the generic mbrtowc() one.} The encoding can be specified
explicitly in load_files/2 for loading Prolog source with an alternative
encoding, open/4 when opening files or using set_stream/2 on any open
stream. For Prolog source files we also provide the encoding/1 directive
that can be used to switch between encodings that are compatible with
US-ASCII (\const{ascii}, \const{iso_latin_1}, \const{utf8} and many
locales). See also \secref{intsrcfile} for writing Prolog files with
non-US-ASCII characters and \secref{unicodesyntax} for syntax issues.
For additional information and Unicode resources, please visit
\url{http://www.unicode.org/}.

SWI-Prolog currently defines and supports the following encodings:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{octet}{}
Default encoding for \const{binary} streams.  This causes
the stream to be read and written fully untranslated.

    \termitem{ascii}{}
7-bit encoding in 8-bit bytes.  Equivalent to \const{iso_latin_1},
but generates errors and warnings on encountering values above
127.

    \termitem{iso_latin_1}{}
8-bit encoding supporting many Western languages. This causes the stream
to be read and written fully untranslated. The above is the SWI-Prolog
native name. This encoding may be specified using the official
\href{https://www.iana.org}{IANA} name \const{ISO-8859-1}.

    \termitem{text}{}
C library default locale encoding for text files.  Files are read and
written using the C library functions mbrtowc() and wcrtomb().  This
may be the same as one of the other encodings, notably it may be the
same as \const{iso_latin_1} for Western languages and \const{utf8}
in a UTF-8 context.

    \termitem{utf8}{}
Multi-byte encoding of full Unicode, compatible with \const{ascii}.
See above. The above is the SWI-Prolog native name.  This encoding
may be specified using the official \href{https://www.iana.org}{IANA}
name \const{UTF-8}.

    \termitem{utf16be}{}
    \nodescription
    \termitem{utf16le}{}
UTF-16 encoding. Reads input in pairs of bytes. \const{utf16be} is
\jargon{Big Endian}, putting the most significant byte first and
\const{utf16le} is \jargon{Little Endian}, putting the most significant
byte second. UTF-16 can represent full Unicode using \jargon{surrogate
pairs}.  The above are the SWI-Prolog native names.  These encodings
may be specified using the official \href{https://www.iana.org}{IANA}
names \const{UTF-16BE} and \const{UTF-16LE}.  For backward compatibility
we also support \const{unicode_be} and \const{unicode_le}.
\end{description}

Note that not all encodings can represent all characters. This implies
that writing text to a stream may cause errors because the stream cannot
represent these characters. The behaviour of a stream on these errors
can be controlled using set_stream/2. Initially the terminal stream
writes the characters using Prolog escape sequences while other streams
generate an I/O exception.


\subsubsection{BOM: Byte Order Mark}		\label{sec:bom}

\index{BOM}\index{Byte Order Mark}%
From \secref{encoding}, you may have got the impression that text files are
complicated. This section deals with a related topic, making life often
easier for the user, but providing another worry to the programmer.
\textbf{BOM} or \jargon{Byte Order Marker} is a technique for
identifying Unicode text files as well as the encoding they use. Such
files start with the Unicode character 0xFEFF, a non-breaking,
zero-width space character. This is a pretty unique sequence that is not
likely to be the start of a non-Unicode file and uniquely distinguishes
the various Unicode file formats. As it is a zero-width blank, it even
doesn't produce any output. This solves all problems, or \ldots

Some formats start off as US-ASCII and may contain some encoding mark to
switch to UTF-8, such as the \verb$encoding="UTF-8"$ in an XML header.
Such formats often explicitly forbid the use of a UTF-8 BOM. In
other cases there is additional information revealing the encoding, making
the use of a BOM redundant or even illegal.

The BOM is handled by SWI-Prolog open/4 predicate. By default,
text files are probed for the BOM when opened for reading. If a BOM is
found, the encoding is set accordingly and the property \term{bom}{true}
is available through stream_property/2. When opening a file for writing,
writing a BOM can be requested using the option \term{bom}{true} with
open/4.


\section{System limits}				\label{sec:limits}

\subsection{Limits on memory areas}		\label{sec:memlimit}

The SWI-Prolog engine uses three \jargon{stacks} the \jargon{local
stack} (also called \jargon{environment stack}) stores the environment
frames used to call predicates as well as choice points. The
\jargon{global stack} (also called \jargon{heap}) contains terms,
floats, strings and large integers. Finally, the \jargon{trail stack}
records variable bindings and assignments to support
\jargon{backtracking}.  Except for available memory, there is no
\jargon{hard limit} for the sizes of the stacks.\footnote{As of
version 9.3.6.  Older versions have a hard limit on 32-bit hardware
of 128Mb for each stack.}

The combined stack size (per thread) has a \jargon{soft limit}
implemented by the writeable flag \prologflag{stack_limit} or the
command line option \cmdlineoption{--stack-limit}.  Currently the
default limit is 1Gb.  Considering portability, applications that need
to modify the default limits are advised to do so using the Prolog
flag \prologflag{stack_limit}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5cm}|}
\hline
Area name & Description \\
\hline
\bf local stack & The local stack is used to store
                       the execution environments of procedure
                       invocations. The space for an environment is
                       reclaimed when it fails, exits without leaving
                       choice points, the alternatives are cut off with
                       the !/0 predicate or no choice points have
                       been created since the invocation and the last
                       subclause is started (last call optimisation). \\
 \bf global stack & The global stack is used to store terms, strings,
	               big integers, rational numbers and floating
		       numbers created during Prolog's
                       execution. Data on this stack is reclaimed
                       by backtracking to a point before the data
                       was created or by garbage collection (provided the
                       data is no longer referenced). \\
\bf trail stack & The trail stack is used to store
                       assignments during execution.  Entries on this
                       stack remain alive until backtracking before the
                       point of creation or the garbage collector
                       determines they are no longer needed.

		       As the trail and global stacks are garbage
		       collected together, a small trail can cause
		       an excessive amount of garbage collections.
		       To avoid this, the trail is automatically
		       resized to be at least 1/6th of the size of
		       the global stack.  \\

\subsubsection{The heap}			\label{sec:heap}

\index{stack,memory management}%
\index{memory,layout}%
With the heap, we refer to the memory area used by malloc()
and friends. SWI-Prolog uses the area to store atoms, functors,
predicates and their clauses, records and other dynamic data. No limits
are imposed on the addresses returned by malloc() and friends.


\subsection{Other Limits}			\label{sec:morelimits}

\begin{description}
    \item[Clauses]
The only limit on clauses is their arity (the number of arguments to
the head), which is limited to 1024.  Raising this limit is easy and
relatively cheap; removing it is harder.

    \item[Atoms and Strings]
SWI-Prolog has no limits on the length of atoms or strings. The number
of atoms is unlimited. Atoms are subject to garbage collection. See
\secref{atomgc}. Both atoms and strings can represent all Unicode code
points, including 0 (\verb$\u0000$). Currently, SWI-Prolog uses a
separate representation for ISO~Latin~1 text (code points
$0\ldots{}255$) and text that includes higher code points. The latter is
represented using the C \ctype{wchar_t} type. On most systems this
implies UCS-4, i.e., 32-bit unsigned integers. On Windows
\ctype{wchar_t} uses UTF-16, which implies that it cannot represent the
code points reserved for \jargon{surrogate pairs} as single code points.
Future versions may switch to using UTF-8 throughout.

    \item[Nesting of terms]
Most built-in predicates that process Prolog terms create an explicitly
managed stack and perform optimization for processing the last argument
of a term. This implies they can process deeply nested terms at constant
and low usage of the C stack, and the system raises a resource error if
no more stack can be allocated.  Currently only read/1 and write/1 (and
all variations thereof) still use the C stack and may cause the system
to crash in an uncontrolled way (i.e., not mapped to a Prolog exception
that can be caught).

    \item[Integers]
SWI-Prolog has two integer representations. \jargon{Tagged integers} are
currently limited to 57~bits.\footnote{Before version 9.3.6, tagged
integers on 32-bit systems had 25~bits and there was a third
representation for 64~bit integers.} Unbounded integers are by default
provided by the GNU GMP library. Alternatively, they may be provided by
the bundled LibBf library. The system can be built without support for
unbounded integers.

    \item[Floating point numbers]
Floating point numbers are represented as C-native double precision
floats, 64-bit IEEE on most machines.
\end{description}

\subsection{Reserved Names}			\label{sec:resnames}

The boot compiler (see \cmdlineoption{-b} option) does not support the module
system.  As large parts of the system are written in Prolog itself
we need some way to avoid name clashes with the user's predicates,
database keys, etc.  Like Edinburgh C-Prolog \cite{CPROLOG:manual} all
predicates, database keys, etc., that should be hidden from the user
start with a dollar (\chr{\$}) sign.

\section{Binary compatibility}			\label{sec:abi-versions}

\index{compatibility,binary}%
\index{ABI,compatibility}%
SWI-Prolog first of all attempts to maintain \jargon{source code}
compatibility between versions. Data and programs can often be
represented in binary form.  This touches a number of interfaces
with varying degrees of compatibility.  The relevant version numbers
and signatures are made available by PL_version_info(), the
\cmdlineoption{--abi-version} and the Prolog flag
\prologflag{abi_version}.

\begin{description}
    \definition{Foreign extensions}
Dynamically loadable foreign extensions have the usual dependencies on
the architecture, ABI model of the (C) compiler, dynamic link library
format, etc. They also depend on the backward compatibility of the PL_*
API functions provided lib \file{libswipl}.

A compatible API allows distribution of foreign extensions in binary
form, notably for platforms on which compilation is complicated (e.g.,
Windows). This compatibility is therefore high on the priority list, but
must infrequently be compromised.

PL_version_info(): \const{PL_VERSION_FLI}, \prologflag{abi_version} key:
\const{foreign_interface}

    \definition{Binary terms}
Terms may be represented in binary format using PL_record_external() and
fast_write/2. As these formats are used for storing binary terms in
databases or communicate terms between Prolog processes in binary form,
great care is taken to maintain compatibility.

PL_version_info(): \const{PL_VERSION_REC}, \prologflag{abi_version} key:
\const{record}

    \definition{QLF files}
QLF files (see qcompile/1) are binary representation of	Prolog file or
module. They represent clauses as sequences of \jargon{virtual machine}
(VM) instructions. Their compatibility relies on the QLF file format and
the ABI of the VM.  Some care is taken to maintain compatibility.

PL_version_info(): \const{PL_VERSION_QLF}, \const{PL_VERSION_QLF_LOAD} and
\const{PL_VERSION_VM}, \prologflag{abi_version} key: \const{qlf},
\const{qlf_min_load}, \const{vmi}

    \definition{Saved states}
Saved states (see \cmdlineoption{-c} and qsave_program/2) is a zip file
that contains the entire Prolog database using the same representation
as QLF files. A saved state may contain additional resources, such as
foreign extensions, data files, etc.  In addition to the dependency
concerns of QLF files, built-in and core library predicates may call
\emph{internal} foreign predicates.  The interface between the public
built-ins and internal foreign predicates changes frequently.  Patch
level releases in the \emph{stable branch} will as much as possible
maintain compatibility.

The relevant ABI version keys are the same as for QLF files with one
addition: PL_version_info(): \const{PL_VERSION_BUILT_IN}, \prologflag{abi_version}
key: \const{built_in}
