\section{Getting started quickly}	\label{sec:quickstart}

\subsection{Starting SWI-Prolog}	\label{sec:startpl}

\subsubsection{Starting SWI-Prolog on Unix} \label{sec:startunix}

By default, SWI-Prolog is installed as `pl', though some administrators
call it `swipl' or `swi-prolog'. The command-line arguments of
SWI-Prolog itself and its utility programs are documented using standard
Unix \program{man} pages. SWI-Prolog is normally operated as an
interactive application simply by starting the program:

\begin{code}
machine% pl
Welcome to SWI-Prolog (Version 5.6.42)
Copyright (c) 1990-2007 University of Amsterdam.
SWI-Prolog comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software,
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
Please visit http://www.swi-prolog.org for details.

For help, use ?- help(Topic). or ?- apropos(Word).

1 ?- 
\end{code}

After starting Prolog, one normally loads a program into it using 
consult/1, which --- for historical reasons --- may be abbreviated by
putting the name of the program file between square brackets.  The
following goal loads the file \file{likes.pl} containing clauses for
the predicates \nopredref{likes}{2}:

\begin{code}
?- [likes].
% likes compiled, 0.00 sec, 596 bytes.

Yes
?- 
\end{code}

After this point, Unix and Windows users unite, so if you are using
Unix please continue at \secref{execquery}.

\subsubsection{Starting SWI-Prolog on Windows}

After SWI-Prolog has been installed on a Windows system, the following
important new things are available to the user:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A folder (called {\em directory} in the remainder of this
	  document) called \file{pl} containing the executables,
	  libraries, etc. of the system.  No files are installed
	  outside this directory.  
    \item A program \program{plwin.exe}, providing a window for interaction
          with Prolog. The program \program{plcon.exe} is a version of
	  SWI-Prolog that runs in a DOS-box.
    \item The file-extension \fileext{pl} is associated with the program
          \program{plwin.exe}.  Opening a \fileext{pl} file will cause
	  \program{plwin.exe} to start, change directory to the
	  directory in which the file-to-open resides and load this
	  file.
\end{itemize}

The normal way to start with the \file{likes.pl} file mentioned in 
\secref{startunix} is by simply double-clicking this file in the Windows
explorer.


\subsection{Executing a query}			\label{sec:execquery}

After loading a program, one can ask Prolog queries about the program.
The query below asks Prolog what food `sam' likes. The system responds
with \mbox{\tt X = <value>} if it can prove the goal for a certain
\arg{X}. The user can type the semi-colon (;)%
	\footnote{On most installations, single-character commands are
		  executed without waiting for the {\sc return} key.}
if (s)he wants another solution, or {\sc return} if (s)he is satisfied,
after which Prolog will say {\bf Yes}. If Prolog answers {\bf No}, it
indicates it cannot find any (more) answers to the query. Finally,
Prolog can answer using an error message to indicate the query or
program contains an error.

\begin{code}
?- likes(sam, X).

X = dahl ;

X = tandoori ;

...

X = chips ;

No
?-
\end{code}


\section{The user's initialisation file}	\label{sec:initfile}

\index{startup file}%
\index{user profile file}%
\index{profile file}%
After the necessary system initialisation the system consults (see
consult/1) the user's startup file. The base-name of this file follows
conventions of the operating system. On MS-Windows, it is the file
\file{pl.ini} and on Unix systems \file{.plrc}. The file is searched
using the file_search_path/2 clauses for \const{user_profile}. The table
below shows the default value for this search-path. The phrase <appdata>
refers to the Windows CSIDL name for the folder. The actual name depends
on the Windows language. English versions typically use
\file{Application Data}. See also win_folder/2

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
		& \bf Unix 	& \bf Windows \\
\hline
\bf local	& \file{.} 	& \file{.} \\
\bf home	& \chr{~} 	& <appdata>/SWI-Prolog \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
After the first startup file is found it is loaded and Prolog
stops looking for further startup files. The name of the
startup file can be changed with the `\argoption{-f}{file}'
option.  If \arg{File} denotes an absolute path, this file is loaded,
otherwise the file is searched for using the same conventions as for
the default startup file. Finally, if \arg{file} is
\const{none}, no file is loaded.

See also the \cmdlineoption{-s} (script) and \cmdlineoption{-F}
(system-wide initialisation) in \secref{cmdline} and \secref{initgoal}.


\section{Initialisation files and goals}		\label{sec:initgoal}

Using command-line arguments (see \secref{cmdline}), SWI-Prolog can be
forced to load files and execute queries for initialisation purposes or
non-interactive operation. The most commonly used options are
\argoption{-f}{file} or \argoption{-s}{file} to make Prolog load a file,
\argoption{-g}{goal} to define an initialisation goal and
\argoption{-t}{goal} to define the \jargon{top-level goal}. The following
is a typical example for starting an application directly from the
command-line.

\begin{code}
machine% pl -s load.pl -g go -t halt
\end{code}

It tells SWI-Prolog to load \file{load.pl}, start the application using
the \jargon{entry-point} \nopredref{go}{0} and ---instead of entering
the interactive top-level--- exit after completing \nopredref{go}{0}. The
\cmdlineoption{-q} may be used to suppress all informational messages.

In MS-Windows, the same can be achieved using a short-cut with
appropriately defined command-line arguments. A typically seen
alternative is to write a file \file{run.pl} with content as illustrated
below. Double-clicking \file{run.pl} will start the application.

\begin{code}
:- [load].			% load program
:- go.				% run it
:- halt.			% and exit
\end{code}

\Secref{plscript} discusses further scripting options and
\chapref{runtime} discusses the generation of runtime executables.
Runtime executables are a mean to deliver executables that do not
require the Prolog system.


\section{Command-line options}			\label{sec:cmdline}

The full set of command-line options is given below:

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{--help}{}
When given as the only option, it summarises the most important options.
Also available as \cmdlineoption{-h} and \cmdlineoption{-help}.  

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--version}{}
When given as the only option, it summarises the version and the
architecture identifier.  Also available as \cmdlineoption{-v}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--arch}{}
When given as the only option, it prints the architecture identifier
(see Prolog flag \prologflag{arch}) and exits. See also
\cmdlineoption{-dump-runtime-variables}. Also available as
\cmdlineoption{-arch}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--dump-runtime-variables}{}
When given as the only option, it prints a sequence of variable settings
that can be used in shell-scripts to deal with Prolog parameters.  This
feature is also used by \program{plld} (see \secref{plld}).  Below is
a typical example of using this feature. Also available as
\cmdlineoption{-dump-runtime-variables}.

\begin{code}
eval `pl --dump-runtime-variables`
cc -I$PLBASE/include -L$PLBASE/runtime/$PLARCH ...
\end{code}

The option can be followed by \const{=sh} to dump in POSIX shell format
(default) or \const{cmd} to dump in MS-Windows \program{cmd.exe}
compatible format.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--win_app}{}
This option is available only in \program{plwin.exe} and is used for the
start-menu item. If causes \program{plwin} to start in the folder
\verb$...\My Documents\Prolog$ or local equivalent thereof (see
win_folder/2).  The \file{Prolog} subdirectory is created if it 
does not exist.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--quiet}{}
\index{verbose}\index{quiet}%
Set the Prolog flag \prologflag{verbose} to \const{silent}, suppressing
informational and banner messages.  Also available as \cmdlineoption{-q}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-L}{size[kmg]}
Give local stack limit (default 16Mb on 32-bit and 32Mb on 64-bit
hardware). Note that there is no space between the size option and its
argument. By default, the argument is interpreted in Kbytes. Postfix the
argument with \const{m} for Mbytes or \const{g} for Gbytes. The
following example specifies 64 Mbytes local stack.

\begin{code}
% pl -L64m
\end{code}
A maximum is useful to stop buggy programs from claiming all memory
resources. \cmdlineoption{-L0} sets the limit to the highest possible
value.%
	\footnote{On 64-bit systems there is no relevant limit and 
		  \cmdlineoption{-L0} is interpreted as 1Gb.  It is
		  possible to ask for larger stack-sizes such as
		  \cmdlineoption{-L32g}}
See \secref{limits}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-G}{size[kmg]}
Give global stack limit (4 Mbytes default). See \cmdlineoption{-L} for
more details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-T}{size[kmg]}
Give trail stack limit (4 Mbytes default). This limit is relatively high
because trail-stack overflows are not often caused by program bugs. See
\cmdlineoption{-L} for more details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem*{-A}{size[kmg]}
Give argument stack limit (1 Mbytes default). The argument stack limits
the maximum nesting of terms that can be compiled and executed. 
SWI-Prolog does `last-argument optimisation' to avoid many deeply nested
structure using this stack. Enlarging this limit is only necessary in
extreme cases. See \cmdlineoption{-L} for more details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-c}{file \ldots}
Compile files into an `intermediate code file'. See \secref{compilation}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-o}{output}
Used in combination with \cmdlineoption{-c} or \cmdlineoption{-b} to
determine output file for compilation.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-O}{}
Optimised compilation. See current_prolog_flag/2 flag
\prologflag{optimise} for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--nodebug}{}
Disable debugging.  See the current_prolog_flag/2 flag
\prologflag{generate_debug_info} for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-s}{file}
Use \arg{file} as a script-file.  The script file is loaded after
the initialisation file specified with the \argoption{-f}{file}
option.  Unlike \argoption{-f}{file}, using \cmdlineoption{-s}
does not stop Prolog from loading the personal initialisation file.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-f}{file}
Use \arg{file} as initialisation file instead of the default
\file{.plrc} (Unix) or \file{pl.ini} (Windows). `\argoption{-f}{none}'
stops SWI-Prolog from searching for a startup file.  This option
can be used as an alternative to \argoption{-s}{file} that stops
Prolog from loading the personal initialisation file. See also
\secref{initfile}. 

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-F}{script}
Selects a startup-script from the SWI-Prolog home directory. The
script-file is named \file{<script>.rc}. The default
\arg{script} name is deduced from the executable, taking the leading
alphanumerical characters (letters, digits and underscore) from the
program-name. \argoption{-F}{none} stops looking for a script. Intended
for simple management of slightly different versions. One could for
example write a script \file{iso.rc} and then select ISO compatibility
mode using \exam{pl -F iso} or make a link from \program{iso-pl} to
\program{pl}.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-g}{goal}
\arg{Goal} is executed just before entering the top level. Default is a
predicate which prints the welcome message. The welcome message can thus
be suppressed by giving \argoption{-g}{true}. \arg{goal} can be a
complex term. In this case quotes are normally needed to protect it from
being expanded by the shell.  A save way to run a goal non-interactively
is here:

\begin{code}
% pl <options> -g go,halt -t 'halt(1)'
\end{code}

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-t}{goal}
Use \arg{goal} as interactive top-level instead of the default goal
prolog/0. \arg{goal} can be a complex term. If the top-level goal
succeeds SWI-Prolog exits with status 0. If it fails the exit status is
1. If the toplevel raises an exception, this is printed as an uncaught
error and the toplevel is restarted. This flag also determines the goal
started by break/0 and abort/0. If you want to stop the user from
entering interactive mode start the application with
`\argoption{-g}{goal}' and give `halt' as top-level.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-tty}{}
Unix only.  Switches controlling the terminal for allowing
single-character commands to the tracer and get_single_char/1. By
default manipulating the terminal is enabled unless the system detects
it is not connected to a terminal or it is running as a GNU-Emacs
inferior process. This flag is sometimes required for smooth interaction
with other applications.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--nosignals}{}
Inhibit any signal handling by Prolog, a property that is sometimes
desirable for embedded applications. This option sets the flag
\prologflag{signals} to \const{false}. See \secref{sigembedded} for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{--home=DIR}{}
Use DIR as home directory.  See \secref{findhome} for details.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-x}{bootfile}
Boot from \arg{bootfile} instead of the system's default boot file. A
bootfile is a file resulting from a Prolog compilation using the
\cmdlineoption{-b} or \cmdlineoption{-c} option or a program saved using
qsave_program/[1,2].

    \cmdlineoptionitem{-p}{alias=path1[:path2 \ldots]}
Define a path alias for file_search_path. \arg{alias} is the name of
the alias, \arg{path1 ...} is a list of values for the alias. On Windows
the list-separator is \chr{;}. On other systems it is \chr{:}. A value
is either a term of the form \mbox{alias(value)} or pathname. The
computed aliases are added to file_search_path/2 using asserta/1, so
they precede predefined values for the alias. See file_search_path/2 for
details on using this file-location mechanism.

    \cmdlineoptionitem{{\tt --}}{}
\index{commandline, arguments}%
Stops scanning for more arguments, so you can pass arguments for your
application after this one.  See current_prolog_flag/2 using the
flag \prologflag{argv} for obtaining the command-line arguments.
\end{description}

The following options are for system maintenance. They are given
for reference only.

\begin{description}
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-b}{initfile \ldots \cmdlineoption{-c} file \ldots}
Boot compilation.  \arg{initfile \ldots} are compiled by the C-written
bootstrap compiler, \arg{file \ldots} by the normal Prolog compiler.
System maintenance only.
    \cmdlineoptionitem{-d}{level}
Set debug level to \arg{level}. Only has effect if the system is
compiled with the \const{-DO_DEBUG} flag. System maintenance
only.
\end{description}


\section{GNU Emacs Interface}			\label{sec:gemacs}

\index{GNU-Emacs}\index{Emacs}
The default Prolog mode for GNU-Emacs can be activated by adding
the following rules to your Emacs initialisation file:

\begin{code}
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append
       '(("\\.pl" . prolog-mode))
       auto-mode-alist))
(setq prolog-program-name "pl")
(setq prolog-consult-string "[user].\n")
;If you want this.  Indentation is either poor or I don't use
;it as intended.
;(setq prolog-indent-width 8)
\end{code}

Unfortunately the default Prolog mode of GNU-Emacs is not very good. An
alternative \file{prolog.el} file for GNU-Emacs 20 is available from
\url{http://www.freesoft.cz/~pdm/software/emacs/prolog-mode/} and for
GNU-Emacs 19 from
\url{http://w1.858.telia.com/~u85810764/Prolog-mode/index.html}


\section{Online Help}				\label{sec:help}

Online help provides a fast lookup and browsing facility to this
manual. The online manual can show predicate definitions as well as
entire sections of the manual.

The online help is displayed from the file \pllib{'MANUAL'}. The file
\pllib{helpidx} provides an index into this file. \pllib{'MANUAL'} is
created from the \LaTeX{} sources with a modified version of
\program{dvitty}, using overstrike for printing bold text and
underlining for rendering italic text. XPCE is shipped with
\pllib{swi_help}, presenting the information from the online help in a
hypertext window. The Prolog flag \prologflag{write_help_with_overstrike}
controls whether or not help/1 writes its output using overstrike to
realise bold and underlined output or not. If this Prolog flag is not set it
is initialised by the help library to \const{true} if the \const{TERM}
variable equals \const{xterm} and \const{false} otherwise. If this
default does not satisfy you, add the following line to your personal
startup file (see \secref{initfile}):

\begin{code}
:- set_prolog_flag(write_help_with_overstrike, true).
\end{code}


\begin{description}
    \predicate{help}{0}{}
Equivalent to \exam{help(help/1)}.

    \predicate{help}{1}{+What}
Show specified part of the manual.  \arg{What} is one of:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
<Name>/<Arity>  & Give help on specified predicate \\
<Name>          & Give help on named predicate with any arity
                  or C interface function with that name \\
<Section>       & Display specified section. Section numbers are
                  dash-separated numbers: \exam{2-3} refers to
                  section 2.3 of the manual.  Section numbers are
                  obtained using apropos/1.
\end{tabular}\end{center}

Examples:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
\exam{?- help(assert).}    & Give help on predicate assert \\
\exam{?- help(3-4).}       & Display section 3.4 of the manual \\
\exam{?- help('PL_retry').}& Give help on interface function PL_retry() \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}

See also apropos/1, and the SWI-Prolog home page at
\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org}, which provides a FAQ, an HTML version
of manual for online browsing and HTML and PDF versions for downloading.

    \predicate{apropos}{1}{+Pattern}
Display all predicates, functions and sections that have {\em
Pattern} in their name or summary description.  Lowercase letters in
\arg{Pattern} also match a corresponding uppercase letter. Example:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
\exam{?- apropos(file).}   & Display predicates, functions and sections
                            that have `file' (or `File', etc.) in their
                            summary description. \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}

    \predicate{explain}{1}{+ToExplain}
Give an explanation on the given `object'. The argument may be any
Prolog data object. If the argument is an atom, a term of the form
\arg{Name/Arity} or a term of the form {\em Module:Name/Arity},
explain/1 describes the predicate as well as possible references to it.
See also gxref/0.

    \predicate{explain}{2}{+ToExplain, -Explanation}
Unify \arg{Explanation} with an explanation for \arg{ToExplain}.
Backtracking yields further explanations.
\end{description}


\section{Command-line history}			\label{sec:history}

SWI-Prolog offers a query substitution mechanism called `history'. The
availability of this feature is controlled by set_prolog_flag/2, using
the \prologflag{history} Prolog flag. By default, history is available if the
Prolog flag \prologflag{readline} is \const{false}. To enable this feature,
remembering the last 50 commands, put the following into your startup
file (see \secref{initfile}):

\begin{code}
:- set_prolog_flag(history, 50).
\end{code}

The history system allows the user to compose new queries from those
typed before and remembered by the system. The available history
commands are shown in \tabref{history}. History expansion is not done if
these sequences appear in quoted atoms or strings.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\verb+!!.+            & Repeat last query \\
\verb+!nr.+           & Repeat query numbered <nr> \\
\verb+!str.+          & Repeat last query starting with <str> \\
\verb+h.+             & Show history of commands \\
\verb+!h.+            & Show this list \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
    \caption{History commands}
    \label{tab:history}
\end{table}


\section{Reuse of top-level bindings}    \label{sec:topvars}

Bindings resulting from the successful execution of a top-level goal
are asserted in a database.  These values may be reused in further
top-level queries as \$Var.  Only the latest binding is available.
Example:

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
1 ?- maplist(plus(1), "hello", X).

X = [105,102,109,109,112] 

Yes
2 ?- format('~s~n', [$X]).
ifmmp

Yes
3 ?-
\end{code}
    \caption{Reusing top-level bindings}
    \label{fig:topevelvars}
\end{figure} 

Note that variables may be set by executing \predref{=}{2}:

\begin{code}
6 ?- X = statistics.

X = statistics

Yes
7 ?- $X.
28.00 seconds cpu time for 183,128 inferences

Trail  stack :    4,096,000        8,192          432 Bytes

Yes
8 ?-
\end{code}

\section{Overview of the Debugger}		\label{sec:debugoverview}

SWI-Prolog has a 6-port tracer, extending the standard 4-port Byrd box
model tracer \cite{Byrd:80,Clocksin:87} with two additional ports. The
optional \arg{unify} port allows the user to inspect the result after
unification of the head. The \arg{exception} port shows exceptions
raised by throw/1 or one of the built-in predicates. See
\secref{exception}.

The standard ports are called \const{call}, \const{exit}, \const{redo},
\const{fail} and \const{unify}. The tracer is started by the trace/0
command, when a spy point is reached and the system is in debugging mode
(see spy/1 and debug/0) or when an exception is raised.

The interactive top-level goal trace/0 means ``trace the next query''.
The tracer shows the port, displaying the port name, the current depth
of the recursion and the goal. The goal is printed using the Prolog
predicate write_term/2.  The style is defined by the Prolog flag
\prologflag{debugger_print_options} and can be modified using this flag
or using the \const{w}, \const{p} and \const{d} commands of the tracer.

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
1 ?- visible(+all), leash(-exit).

Yes
2 ?- trace, min([3, 2], X).
  Call:  ( 3) min([3, 2], G235) ? creep
  Unify: ( 3) min([3, 2], G235)
  Call:  ( 4) min([2], G244) ? creep
  Unify: ( 4) min([2], 2)
  Exit:  ( 4) min([2], 2)
  Call:  ( 4) min(3, 2, G235) ? creep
  Unify: ( 4) min(3, 2, G235)
  Call:  ( 5) 3 < 2 ? creep
  Fail:  ( 5) 3 < 2 ? creep
  Redo:  ( 4) min(3, 2, G235) ? creep
  Exit:  ( 4) min(3, 2, 2)
  Exit:  ( 3) min([3, 2], 2)

Yes
[trace] 3 ?-
\end{code}
    \caption{Example trace}
    \label{fig:tracer}
\end{figure}

On {\em leashed ports} (set with the predicate leash/1, default are
\const{call}, \const{exit}, \const{redo} and \const{fail}) the user is
prompted for an action. All actions are single character commands which
are executed {\bf without} waiting for a return, unless the command-line
option \cmdlineoption{-tty} is active. Tracer options:

\begin{description}
    \traceoption{+}{Spy}{
Set a spy point (see spy/1) on the current predicate.} 
    \traceoption{-}{No spy}{
Remove the spy point (see nospy/1) from the current predicate.} 
    \traceoption{/}{Find}{
Search for a port.  After the `/', the user can enter a line
to specify the port to search for.  This line consists of a set of
letters indicating the port type, followed by an optional term,
that should unify with the goal run by the port.  If no term is
specified it is taken as a variable, searching for any port of the
specified type.  If an atom is given, any goal whose functor has a
name equal to that atom matches.  Examples:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lp{3in}}
\tt /f                  & Search for any fail port \\
\tt /fe solve           & Search for a fail or exit port of any goal with
                          name \const{solve} \\
\tt /c solve(a, _)      & Search for a call to {solve}/2 whose first argument
                          is a variable or the atom \const{a} \\
\tt /a member(_, _)     & Search for any port on member/2. This is equivalent
                          to setting a spy point on member/2. \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}}
    \traceoption{.}{Repeat find}{
Repeat the last find command (see `/').}
    \traceoption{A}{Alternatives}{
Show all goals that have alternatives.} 
    \traceoption{C}{Context}{
Toggle `Show Context'. If \const{on}, the context module of the goal is
displayed between square brackets (see \secref{modules}).

    \traceoption{a}{Abort}{
Abort Prolog execution (see abort/0).} 
    \traceoption{b}{Break}{
Enter a Prolog break environment (see break/0).}

Terminate Prolog (see halt/0).} 
    \traceoption{f}{Fail}{
Force failure of the current goal.}

\end{description}

The ideal 4 port Byrd box model \cite{Byrd:80} as described in many
Prolog books \cite{Clocksin:87} is not visible in many Prolog
implementations because code optimisation removes part of the choice-
and exit-points. Backtrack points are not shown if either the goal
succeeded deterministically or its alternatives were removed using the
cut. When running in debug mode (debug/0) choice points are only
destroyed when removed by the cut. In debug mode, last call optimisation
is switched off.%
	\footnote{This implies the system can run out of local
		  stack in debug mode, while no problems arise when
		  running in non-debug mode.}

Reference information to all predicates available for manipulating the
debugger is in \secref{debugger}.


\section{Compilation}			\label{sec:compilation}

\subsection{During program development}	\label{sec:develcomp}

During program development, programs are normally loaded using
consult/1, or the list abbreviation. It is common practice to organise a
project as a collection of source files and a \jargon{load-file}, a
Prolog file containing only use_module/[1,2] or ensure_loaded/1
directives, possibly with a definition of the \jargon{entry-point} of
the program, the predicate that is normally used to start the program.
This file is often called \file{load.pl}.  If the entry-point is called
{\em go}, a typical session starts as:

\begin{code}
% pl
<banner>

1 ?- [load].
<compilation messages>

Yes
2 ?- go.
<program interaction>
\end{code}

When using Windows, the user may open \file{load.pl} from the Windows
explorer, which will cause \program{plwin.exe} to be started in the
directory holding \file{load.pl}.  Prolog loads \file{load.pl} before
entering the top-level.


\subsection{For running the result}	\label{sec:runcomp}

There are various options if you want to make your program ready
for real usage.  The best choice depends on whether the program
is to be used only on machines holding the SWI-Prolog development
system, the size of the program and the operating system (Unix
vs.\ Windows).


\subsubsection{Using PrologScript}	\label{sec:plscript}

New in version 4.0.5 is the possibility to use a Prolog source file
directly as a Unix script-file.  The same mechanism is useful to
specify additional parameters for running a Prolog file on Windows.

If the first letter of a Prolog file is \verb$#$, the first line is
treated as comment.%
	\footnote{The \texttt{\#}-sign can be the legal start of a
	normal Prolog clause. In the unlikely case this is required,
	leave the first line blank or add a header-comment.}
To create a Prolog script, make the first line start like this:

\begin{quote}
\verb$#!/path/to/pl$ <options> \verb$-s$
\end{quote}

Prolog recognises this starting sequence and causes the interpreter
to receive the following argument-list:

\begin{quote}
\verb$/path/to/pl$ <options> \verb$-s$ <script> \verb$--$ <ScriptArguments>
\end{quote}

Instead of \cmdlineoption{-s}, the user may use \cmdlineoption{-f} to
stop Prolog from looking for a personal initialisation file.  

Here is a simple script doing expression evaluation:

\begin{code}
#!/usr/bin/pl -q -t main -f

eval :-
	current_prolog_flag(argv, Argv),
	append(_, [--|Args], Argv),
	concat_atom(Args, ' ', SingleArg),
	term_to_atom(Term, SingleArg),
	Val is Term,
	format('~w~n', [Val]).

main :-
	catch(eval, E, (print_message(error, E), fail)),
	halt.
main :-
	halt(1).
\end{code}

And here are two example runs:

\begin{code}
% eval 1+2
3
% eval foo
ERROR: Arithmetic: `foo/0' is not a function
%
\end{code}

\paragraph{The Windows version} supports the \verb$#!$ construct too,
but here it serves a rather different role.  The Windows shell already
allows the user to start Prolog source files directly through the
Windows file-type association.  Windows however makes it rather
complicated to provide additional parameters, such as the required
stack-size for an individual Prolog file.  The \verb$#!$ line provides
for this, providing a more flexible approach than changing the global
defaults.  The following starts Prolog with unlimited stack-size on
the given source file:

\begin{code}
#!/usr/bin/pl -L0 -T0 -G0 -s

....
\end{code}

Note the use of \verb$/usr/bin/pl$, which specifies the interpreter.
This argument is ignored in the Windows version, but required to ensure
best cross-platform compatibility.


\subsubsection{Creating a shell-script}		\label{sec:shellscript}

With the introduction of \jargon{PrologScript} (see \secref{plscript}),
using shell-scripts as explained in this section has become redundant
for most applications.

Especially on Unix systems and not-too-large applications, writing
a shell-script that simply loads your application and calls the
entry-point is often a good choice.  A skeleton for the script is
given below, followed by the Prolog code to obtain the program
arguments.

\begin{code}
#!/bin/sh

base=<absolute-path-to-source>
PL=pl

exec $PL -f none -g "load_files(['$base/load'],[silent(true)])" \
	 -t go -- $*
\end{code}

\begin{code}
go :-
	current_prolog_flag(argv, Arguments),
	append(_SytemArgs, [--|Args], Arguments), !,
	go(Args).

go(Args) :-
	...
\end{code}

On Windows systems, similar behaviour can be achieved by creating a 
shortcut to Prolog, passing the proper options or writing a \fileext{bat}
file.


\subsubsection{Creating a saved-state}		\label{sec:makestate}

For larger programs, as well as for programs that are required to run on
systems that do not have the SWI-Prolog development system installed,
creating a saved state is the best solution. A saved state is created
using qsave_program/[1,2] or using the linker plld(1). A saved state is
a file containing machine-independent intermediate code in a format
dedicated for fast loading. Optionally, the emulator may be integrated
in the saved state, creating a single-file, but machine-dependent,
executable.  This process is described in \chapref{runtime}.


\subsubsection{Compilation using the -c command-line option}
\label{sec:cmdlinecomp}

This mechanism loads a series of Prolog source files and then creates
a saved-state as qsave_program/2 does.  The command syntax is:

\begin{code}
% pl [option ...] [-o output] -c file ...
\end{code}

The \arg{options} argument are options to qsave_program/2 written in
the format below.  The option-names and their values are described with
qsave_program/2.

\begin{quote}
\verb$--${\em option-name}\verb$=$\em{option-value}
\end{quote}

For example, to create a stand-alone executable that starts by executing
\nopredref{main}{0} and for which the source is loaded through
\file{load.pl}, use the command

\begin{code}
% pl --goal=main --stand_alone=true -o myprog -c load.pl
\end{code}

This performs exactly the same as executing

\begin{code}
% pl
<banner>
?- [load].
?- qsave_program(myprog,
		 [ goal(main),
		   stand_alone(true)
		 ]).
?- halt.
\end{code}

\section{Environment Control (Prolog flags)}	\label{sec:flags}

The predicates current_prolog_flag/2 and set_prolog_flag/2 allow the
user to examine and modify the execution environment.  It provides
access to whether optional features are available on this version,
operating system, foreign-code environment, command-line arguments,
version, as well as runtime flags to control the runtime behaviour
of certain predicates to achieve compatibility with other Prolog
environments.

\begin{description}
    \predicate[ISO]{current_prolog_flag}{2}{?Key, -Value}
The predicate current_prolog_flag/2 defines an interface to installation
features: options compiled in, version, home, etc. With both arguments
unbound, it will generate all defined Prolog flags. With the `Key'
instantiated it unifies the value of the Prolog flag. Flag values are
typed. Flags marked as \const{bool} can have the values \const{true} and
\const{false}. Some Prolog flags are not defined in all versions, which
is normally indicated in the documentation below as \textit{``if present
and true''}. A Boolean Prolog flag is true iff the Prolog flag is
present {\bf and} the \arg{Value} is the atom \const{true}. Tests for
such flags should be written as below.

\begin{code}
	(   current_prolog_flag(windows, true)
	->  <Do MS-Windows things>
	;   <Do normal things>
	)
\end{code}



\begin{description}
    \prologflagitem{abort_with_exception}{bool}{rw}
Determines how abort/0 is realised.  See the description of abort/0
for details.

    \prologflagitem{address_bits}{integer}{r}
Address-size of the hosting machine.  Typically 32 or 64.  Except for
the maximum stack limit, this has few implications to the user.  See
also the Prolog flag \prologflag{arch}.

    \prologflagitem{agc_margin}{integer}{rw}
If this amount of atoms has been created since the last atom-garbage
collection, perform atom garbage collection at the first opportunity.
Initial value is 10,000.   May be changed.  A value of 0 (zero) disables
atom garbage collection.  See also PL_register_atom().

    \prologflagitem{allow_variable_name_as_functor}{bool}{rw}
If true (default is false), \exam{Functor(arg)} is read as if it was
written \exam{'Functor'(arg)}. Some applications use the Prolog read/1
predicate for reading an application defined script language. In these
cases, it is often difficult to explain to non-Prolog users of the
application that constants and functions can only start with a lowercase
letter. Variables can be turned into atoms starting with an uppercase
atom by calling read_term/2 using the option \const{variable_names} and
binding the variables to their name. Using this feature, F(x) can be
turned into valid syntax for such script languages. Suggested by Robert
van Engelen.  SWI-Prolog specific.

    \prologflagitem{argv}{list}{r}
List is a list of atoms representing the command-line arguments used to
invoke SWI-Prolog.  Please note that {\bf all} arguments are included
in the list returned.

    \prologflagitem{arch}{atom}{r}
Identifier for the hardware and operating system SWI-Prolog is running
on. Used to select foreign files for the right architecture. See also
\secref{shlib} and file_search_path/2.

    \prologflagitem{associate}{atom}{rw}
On Windows systems, this is set to the filename extension (\const{pl}
(default) or \const{pro} (can be selected in the installer)) associated
with \program{plwin.exe}.

    \prologflagitem{autoload}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default) autoloading of library functions is enabled.
Note that autoloading only works if the flag \prologflag{unknown} is
\emph{not} set to \const{fail}. See \secref{autoload}.

    \prologflagitem{backquoted_string}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), read translates text between
backquotes into a string object (see \secref{strings}).  This flag is
mainly for compatibility to LPA Prolog.

    \prologflagitem{bounded}{bool}{r}
ISO Prolog flag. If \const{true}, integer representation is bound by
\prologflag{min_integer} and \prologflag{max_integer}. If \const{false}
integers can be arbitrarily large and the \prologflag{min_integer} and
\prologflag{max_integer} are not present. See \secref{artypes}.

    \prologflagitem{c_cc}{atom}{r}
Name of the C-compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog.  Normally either gcc
or cc.  See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{c_ldflags}{atom}{r}
Special linker flags passed to link SWI-Prolog.  See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{c_libs}{atom}{r}
Libraries passed to the C-linker when SWI-Prolog was linked.  May be used
to determine the libraries needed to create statically linked extensions
for SWI-Prolog.  See \secref{plld}.

    \prologflagitem{char_conversion}{bool}{rw}
Determines whether character-conversion takes place while reading terms.
See also char_conversion/2.

    \prologflagitem{character_escapes}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default), read/1 interprets \verb$\$ escape sequences
in quoted atoms and strings. May be changed. This flag is local to the
module in which it is changed.

    \prologflagitem{compiled_at}{atom}{r}
Describes when the system has been compiled. Only available if the
C-compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog provides the __DATE__ and __TIME__
macros.

    \prologflagitem{console_menu}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} in \program{plwin.exe} to indicate the console
supports menus.  See also \secref{plwin}.

    \prologflagitem{cpu_count}{integer}{rw}
Number of physical CPUs in the system. Unfortunately there is no
standard to get this number, so on most operating systems this flag is
not available. It is marked read-write both to allow obtaining this
value later and to allow pretending the system has more or less
processors. See also thread_setconcurrency/2 and the library
\pllib{thread}. Currently this flag is supported in Windows and Linux if
\file{/proc} is enabled. If you can provide us with a C-code fragment
getting the number for a specific OS, please submit an enhancement
report at \url{http://gollem.science.uva.nl/bugzilla/}

    \prologflagitem{dde}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} if this instance of Prolog supports DDE as
described in \secref{DDE}.

    \prologflagitem{debug}{bool}{rw}
Switch debugging mode on/off.  If debug mode is activated the system
traps encountered spy-points (see spy/1) and trace-points (see trace/1).
In addition, last-call optimisation is disabled and the system is
more conservative in destroying choice points to simplify debugging.

Disabling these optimisations can cause the system to run out of memory
on programs that behave correctly if debug mode is off.

    \prologflagitem{debug_on_error}{bool}{rw}
If {\tt true}, start the tracer after an error is detected.  Otherwise
just continue execution.  The goal that raised the error will normally
fail.  See also fileerrors/2 and the Prolog flag {\tt report_error}.  May
be changed.  Default is {\tt true}, except for the runtime version.

    \prologflagitem{debugger_print_options}{term}{rw}
This argument is given as option-list to write_term/2 for printing goals
by the debugger.  Modified by the `w', `p' and `<N> d' commands of the
debugger.  Default is \exam{[quoted(true), portray(true),
max_depth(10), attributes(portray)]}.

    \prologflagitem{debugger_show_context}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, show the context module while printing a stack-frame in
the tracer.  Normally controlled using the `C' option of the tracer.

    \prologflagitem{dialect}{atom}{r}
Fixed to \const{swi}.  The code below is a reliable and portable way to
detect SWI-Prolog.
	
\begin{code}
is_dialect(swi) :-
	catch(current_prolog_flag(dialect, swi), _, fail).
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{double_quotes}{codes,chars,atom,string}{rw}
This flag determines how double quoted strings are read by Prolog and
is ---like \prologflag{character_escapes}--- maintained for each module. If
\const{codes} (default), a list of character-codes is returned, if
\const{chars} a list of one-character atoms, if \const{atom} double
quotes are the same as single-quotes and finally, \const{string} reads
the text into a Prolog string (see \secref{strings}). See also
atom_chars/2 and atom_codes/2.

    \prologflagitem{dynamic_stacks}{bool}{r}
If \const{true}, the system uses some form of `sparse-memory management'
to realise the stacks. If false, malloc()/realloc() are used for the
stacks. In earlier days this had consequences for foreign code. As of
version 2.5, this is no longer the case.

Systems using `sparse-memory management' are a bit faster as there is no
stack-shifter. On most systems using sparse-memory management memory is
actually returned to the system after a garbage collection or call to
trim_stacks/0 (called by prolog/0 after finishing a user-query).

    \prologflagitem{editor}{atom}{rw}
Determines the editor used by edit/1. See \secref{listing} for
details on selecting the editor used.

    \prologflagitem{emacs_inferior_process}{bool}{r}
If true, SWI-Prolog is running as an \jargon{inferior process} of
(GNU/X-)Emacs.  SWI-Prolog assumes this is the case if the environment
variable \env{EMACS} is \const{t} and \env{INFERIOR} is \const{yes}.

    \prologflagitem{encoding}{atom}{rw}
Default encoding used for opening files in \const{text} mode. The
initial value is deduced from the environment. See \secref{encoding} for
details.

    \prologflagitem{executable}{atom}{r}
Path-name of the running executable. Used by qsave_program/2 as
default emulator.

    \prologflagitem{file_name_variables}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), expand \file{\$\arg{varname}}
and \chr{~} in arguments of built-in predicates that accept a file
name (open/3, exists_file/1, access_file/2, etc.). The predicate
expand_file_name/2 can be used to expand environment variables and
wildcard patterns. This Prolog flag is intended for backward
compatibility with older versions of SWI-Prolog.

    \prologflagitem{float_format}{atom}{rw}
C-library printf() format specification used by write/1 and friends to
determine how floating point numbers are printed. The default is {\tt
\%g}. The specified value is passed to printf() without further
checking. For example, if you want more digits printed, {\tt \%.12g}
will print all floats using 12 digits instead of the default 6.

When using quoted-write, the output is guaranteed to contain a decimal
dot or exponent, so read/1 reads a floating point number. See also
format/[1,2], write_term/[2,3].

    \prologflagitem{gc}{bool}{rw}
If true (default), the garbage collector is active.  If false, neither
garbage-collection, nor stack-shifts will take place, even not on
explicit request.  May be changed.

    \prologflagitem{generate_debug_info}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default) generate code that can be debugged using
trace/0, spy/1, etc. Can be set to \const{false} using the
\cmdlineoption{-nodebug}. The predicate load_files/2 restores the value
of this flag after loading a file, causing modifications to be local
to a source file.  Many of the libraries have
\verb$:- set_prolog_flag(generate_debug_info, false)$ to hide their
details from a normal trace.%
	\footnote{In the current implementation this only causes a flag
		  to be set on the predicate that causes children to be
		  hidden from the debugger. The name anticipates on
		  anticipated changes to the compiler.}

    \prologflagitem{gmp_version}{integer}{r}
If Prolog is linked with GMP, this flag gives the major version of the
GMP library used.  See also \secref{gmpforeign}.

    \prologflagitem{gui}{bool}{r}
Set to \const{true} if XPCE is around and can be used for graphics.

    \prologflagitem{history}{integer}{rw}
If $\arg{integer}> 0$, support Unix \program{csh(1)} like history as
described in \secref{history}. Otherwise, only support reusing commands
through the command-line editor. The default is to set this Prolog flag to 0
if a command-line editor is provided (see Prolog flag \prologflag{readline}) and
15 otherwise.

    \prologflagitem{home}{atom}{r}
SWI-Prolog's notion of the home-directory.  SWI-Prolog uses its home
directory to find its startup file as
\file{<home>/boot32.prc} (32-bit machines) or
\file{<home>/boot64.prc} (64-bit machines) and to find its library as
\file{<home>/library}.

    \prologflagitem{hwnd}{integer}{r}
In \program{plwin.exe}, this refers to the MS-Windows window-handle of
the console window.

    \prologflagitem{integer_rounding_function}{down,toward_zero}{r}
ISO Prolog flag describing rounding by \verb$//$ and \verb$rem$ arithmetic
functions. Value depends on the C-compiler used.

    \prologflagitem{iso}{bool}{rw}
Include some weird ISO compatibility that is incompatible to normal
SWI-Prolog behaviour.  Currently it has the following effect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \functor{/}{2} (float division) {\em always} return a
          float, even if applied to integers that can be divided.
    \item In the standard order of terms (see \secref{standardorder}),
          all floats are before all integers.
    \item atom_length/2 yields an instantiation error if the first
          argument is a number.
    \item clause/[2,3] raises a permission error when accessing static
          predicates.
    \item abolish/[1,2] raises a permission error when accessing static
          predicates.
\end{itemize}

    \prologflagitem{large_files}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, SWI-Prolog has been compiled with
\jargon{large file support} (LFS) and is capable to access files larger
than 2GB on 32-bit hardware. Large file-support is default on
installations built using \program{configure} that support it and may be
switched off using the configure option \const{--disable-largefile}.

    \prologflagitem{max_arity}{unbounded}{r}
ISO Prolog flag describing there is no maximum arity to compound terms.

    \prologflagitem{max_integer}{integer}{r}
Maximum integer value if integers are \emph{bounded}.  See also
the flag \prologflag{bounded} and \secref{artypes}.

    \prologflagitem{max_tagged_integer}{integer}{r}
Maximum integer value represented as a `tagged' value.  Tagged integers
require 1 word storage.  Larger integers are represented as `indirect data'
and require significantly more space.

    \prologflagitem{max_threads}{integer}{r}
Provided on multi-threaded versions to indicate the maximum number of 
Prolog threads supported.  Currently (version 5.6.27) the limit is 100.

    \prologflagitem{min_integer}{integer}{r}
Minimum integer value if integers are \emph{bounded}.  See also
the flag \prologflag{bounded} and \secref{artypes}.

    \prologflagitem{min_tagged_integer}{integer}{r}
Start of the tagged-integer value range.

    \prologflagitem{occurs_check}{atom}{rw}
This flag controls unification that creates an infinite tree (also
called \jargon{cyclic term}) and can have three values. Using
\const{false} (default), unification succeeds, creating an infinite
tree. Using \const{true}, unification behaves as unify_with_occurs_check/2,
failing silently. Using \const{error}, an attempt to create a cyclic
term results in an \except{occurs_check} exception. The latter
is intended for debugging unintentional creations of cyclic terms. Note
that this flag is a global flag modifying fundamental behaviour of
Prolog. Changing the flag from its default may cause libraries to stop
functioning properly.

    \prologflagitem{open_shared_object}{bool}{r}
If true, open_shared_object/2 and friends are implemented, providing
access to shared libraries (\fileext{so} files) or dynamic link
libraries (\fileext{DLL} files).

    \prologflagitem{optimise}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, compile in optimised mode. The initial value is
\const{true} if Prolog was started with the \cmdlineoption{-O}
command-line option.

Currently optimise compilation implies compilation of arithmetic,
and deletion of redundant true/0 that may result from expand_goal/2.

Later versions might imply various other optimisations such as
integrating small predicates into their callers, eliminating constant
expressions and other predictable constructs. Source code optimisation
is never applied to predicates that are declared dynamic (see
dynamic/1).

    \prologflagitem{pid}{int}{r}
Process identifier of the running Prolog process.  Existence of this
flag is implementation defined.

    \prologflagitem{pipe}{bool}{rw}
If true, \exam{open(pipe(command), mode, Stream)}, etc.\ are supported.
Can be changed to disable the use of pipes in applications testing this
feature.  Not recommended.

    \prologflagitem{prompt_alternatives_on}{atom}{rw}
\index{prompt, alternatives}%
Determines prompting for alternatives in the Prolog toplevel. Default is
\const{determinism}, which implies the system prompts for alternatives
if the goal succeeded while leaving choicepoints.  Many classical Prolog
systems behave as \const{groundness}: they prompt for alternatives if
and only if the query contains variables.

    \prologflagitem{readline}{bool}{r}
If true, SWI-Prolog is linked with the readline library.  This is done
by default if you have this library installed on your system.  It is
also true for the Win32 plwin.exe version of SWI-Prolog, which realises
a subset of the readline functionality.

    \prologflagitem{resource_database}{atom}{r}
Set to the absolute-filename of the attached state.  Typically this is
the file \file{boot32.prc}, the file specified with \cmdlineoption{-x}
or the running executable.  See also resource/3.

    \prologflagitem{report_error}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, print error messages, otherwise suppress them. May
be changed. See also the \prologflag{debug_on_error} Prolog flag.
Default is \const{true}, except for the runtime version. 

    \prologflagitem{runtime}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, SWI-Prolog is compiled with -DO_RUNTIME,
disabling various useful development features (currently the tracer and
profiler).

    \prologflagitem{saved_program}{bool}{r}
If present and \const{true}, Prolog has been started from a state saved
with qsave_program/[1,2].

    \prologflagitem{shared_object_extension}{atom}{r}
Extension used by the operating system for shared objects. \fileext{so}
for most Unix systems and \fileext{dll} for Windows.  Used for locating
files using the \const{file_type} \const{executable}.  See also
absolute_file_name/3.

    \prologflagitem{shared_object_search_path}{atom}{r}
Name of the environment variable used by the system to search for shared
objects.

    \prologflagitem{signals}{bool}{r}
Determine whether Prolog is handling signals (software interrupts). This
flag is \const{false} if the hosting OS does not support signal handling
or the command-line option \cmdlineoption{-nosignals} is active.  See
\secref{sigembedded} for details.

    \prologflagitem{system_thread_id}{int}{r}
Available in multi-threaded version (see \secref{threads}) where the
operating system provides system-wide integer thread identifiers. The
integer is the thread-identifier used by the operating system for the
calling thread. See also thread_self/1.

    \prologflagitem{last_call_optimisation}{bool}{rw}
Determines whether or not last-call optimisation is enabled.
Normally the value of this flag is equal to the \prologflag{debug} flag.  As
programs may run out of stack if last-call optimisation is omitted,
it is sometimes necessary to enable it during debugging.

    \prologflagitem{timezone}{integer}{r}
Offset in seconds west of GMT of the current time-zone. Set at
initialization time from the \const{timezone} variable associated with
the POSIX tzset() function. See also convert_time/2.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_print_anon}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true}, top-level variables starting with an underscore
(\chr{_}) are printed normally.  If \const{false} they are hidden.
This may be used to hide bindings in complex queries from the top-level.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_print_options}{term}{rw}
This argument is given as option-list to write_term/2 for printing results
of queries. Default is \exam{[quoted(true), portray(true),
max_depth(10), attributes(portray)]}.

    \prologflagitem{toplevel_var_size}{int}{rw}
Maximum size counted in literals of a term returned as a binding for a
variable in a top-level query that is saved for re-use using the
\chr{$} variable reference.  See \secref{topvars}.

    \prologflagitem{trace_gc}{bool}{rw}
If true (false is the default), garbage collections and stack-shifts
will be reported on the terminal. May be changed. Values are reported in
bytes as $G$+$T$, where $G$ is the global stack value and $T$ the trail
stack value. `Gained' describes the number of bytes reclaimed. `used'
the number of bytes on the stack after GC and `free' the number of bytes
allocated, but not in use. Below is an example output.

\begin{code}
% GC: gained 236,416+163,424 in 0.00 sec; used 13,448+5,808; free 72,568+47,440
\end{code}

    \prologflagitem{tty_control}{bool}{r}
Determines whether the terminal is switched to raw mode for
get_single_char/1, which also reads the user-actions for the trace.  May
be set.  See also the \cmdlineoption{+/-tty} command-line option.

    \prologflagitem{unix}{bool}{r}
\index{unix}%
If present and \const{true}, the operating system is some version of
Unix. Defined if the C-compiler used to compile this version of
SWI-Prolog either defines \verb$__unix__$ or \const{unix}. On other
systems this flag is not available.

    \prologflagitem{unknown}{fail,warning,error}{rw}
Determines the behaviour if an undefined procedure is encountered.  If
\const{fail}, the predicates fails silently.  If \const{warn}, a warning
is printed, and execution continues as if the predicate was not defined
and if \const{error} (default), an \except{existence_error} exception
is raised.  This flag is local to each module.  Switching this flag to
\const{fail} disables autoloading and thus forces complete and
consistent use of use_module/[1,2] to load the required libraries.

    \prologflagitem{verbose}{Atom}{rw}
This flags is used by print_message/2.  If its value is \const{silent},
messages of type \const{informational} and \const{banner} are suppressed.
The \cmdlineoption{-q} switches the value from the initial
\const{normal} to \const{silent}.

    \prologflagitem{verbose_autoload}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} the normal consult message will be printed if a library
is autoloaded. By default this message is suppressed. Intended to be
used for debugging purposes.

    \prologflagitem{verbose_load}{bool}{rw}
If \const{false} normal consult messages will be suppressed.  Default is
\const{true}.  The value of this flag is normally controlled by the
option \term{silent}{Bool} provided by load_files/2.

    \prologflagitem{verbose_file_search}{bool}{rw}
If \const{true} (default \const{false}), print messages indicating the
progress of absolute_file_name/[2,3] in locating files.  Intended for
debugging complicated file-search paths.  See also file_search_path/2.

    \prologflagitem{version}{integer}{r}
The version identifier is an integer with value: $$10000 \times
\arg{Major} + 100 \times \arg{Minor} + \arg{Patch}$$
Note that in releases up to 2.7.10 this Prolog flag yielded an atom holding
the three numbers separated by dots. The current representation is much
easier for implementing version-conditional statements.

    \prologflagitem{version_data}{swi(Major, Minor, Patch, Extra)}{r}
Part of the dialect compatibility layer, See also the Prolog flag
\prologflag{dialect} and \secref{dialect}. \arg{Extra} provides
platform specific version information.  Currently it is simply unified
to \const{[]}.

    \prologflagitem{windows}{bool}{r}
\index{windows}%
If present and \const{true}, the operating system is an implementation
of Microsoft Windows (NT/2000/XP, etc.). This flag is only available on
MS-Windows based versions.

    \prologflagitem{write_attributes}{atom}{rw}
Defines how write/1 and friends write attributed variables.  The option
values are described with the \const{attributes} option of
write_term/3.  Default is \const{ignore}.

    \prologflagitem{write_help_with_overstrike}{bool}{r}
Internal flag used by help/1 when writing to a terminal. If
present and \const{true} it prints bold and underlined text using
\jargon{overstrike}.

    \prologflagitem{xpce}{bool}{r}
Available and set to \const{true} if the XPCE graphics system is loaded.

    \prologflagitem{xpce_version}{atom}{r}
Available and set to the version of the loaded XPCE system.
\end{description}

    \predicate[ISO]{set_prolog_flag}{2}{+Key, +Value}
Define a new Prolog flag or change its value.  \arg{Key} is an atom.
If the flag is a system-defined flag that is not marked
\jargon{changeable} above, an attempt to modify the flag yields a
\except{permission_error}.  If the provided \arg{Value} does not
match the type of the flag, a \except{type_error} is raised.

In addition to ISO, SWI-Prolog allows for user-defined Prolog flags. The
type of the flag is determined from the initial value and cannot be
changed afterwards. Defined types are \const{boolean} (if the initial
value is one of \const{false}, \const{true}, \const{on} or \const{off}),
\const{atom} if the initial value is any other atom, \const{integer} if
the value is an integer that can be expressed as a 64-bit signed value.
Any other initial value results in an untyped flag that can represent
any valid Prolog term.
\end{description}


\section{An overview of hook predicates}	\label{sec:hooks}

\index{hooks}
SWI-Prolog provides a large number of hooks, mainly to control handling
messages, debugging, startup, shut-down, macro-expansion, etc.  Below
is a summary of all defined hooks with an indication of their
portability.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [portray/1]
Hook into write_term/3 to alter the way terms are printed (ISO).
    \item [message_hook/3]
Hook into print_message/2 to alter the way system messages are printed
(Quintus/SICStus).
    \item [library_directory/1]
Hook into absolute_file_name/3 to define new library directories.
(most Prolog system).
    \item [file_search_path/2]
Hook into absolute_file_name/3 to define new search-paths
(Quintus/SICStus).
    \item [term_expansion/2]
Hook into load_files/2 to modify read terms before they are compiled
(macro-processing) (most Prolog system).
    \item [goal_expansion/2]
Same as term_expansion/2 for individual goals (SICStus).
    \item [prolog_load_file/2]
Hook into load_files/2 to load other data-formats for Prolog sources
from `non-file' resources.  The load_files/2 predicate is the ancestor
of consult/1, use_module/1, etc.
    \item [prolog_edit:locate/3]
Hook into edit/1 to locate objects (SWI).
    \item [prolog_edit:edit_source/1]
Hook into edit/1 to call some internal editor (SWI).
    \item [prolog_edit:edit_command/2]
Hook into edit/1 to define the external editor to use (SWI).
    \item [prolog_list_goal/1]
Hook into the tracer to list the code associated to a particular goal
(SWI).
    \item [prolog_trace_interception/4]
Hook into the tracer to handle trace-events (SWI).
    \item [prolog:debug_control_hook/1]
Hook in spy/1, nospy/1, nospyall/0 and debugging/0 to extend these
control-predicates to higher-level libraries.
    \item [prolog:help_hook/1]
Hook in help/0, help/1 and apropos/1 to extend the help-system.
    \item [resource/3]
Defines a new resource (not really a hook, but similar) (SWI).    
    \item [exception/3]
Old attempt to a generic hook mechanism.  Handles undefined predicates (SWI).
    \item [attr_unify_hook/2]
Unification hook for attributed variables. Can be defined in any
module.  See \secref{attvar} for details.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Automatic loading of libraries}	\label{sec:autoload}

If ---at runtime--- an undefined predicate is trapped the system will
first try to import the predicate from the module's default module. If
this fails the \jargon{auto loader} is activated. On first activation an
index to all library files in all library directories is loaded in core
(see library_directory/1 and file_search_path/2). If the undefined
predicate can be located in one of the libraries that library file
is automatically loaded and the call to the (previously undefined)
predicate is restarted. By default this mechanism loads the file
silently. The current_prolog_flag/2 \prologflag{verbose_autoload} is provided
to get verbose loading. The Prolog flag \prologflag{autoload} can be used to
enable/disable the entire auto load system.

The auto-loader only works if the unknown flag (see unknown/2) is set to
\const{trace} (default).  A more appropriate interaction with this flag
should be considered.

Autoloading only handles (library) source files that use the module
mechanism described in \chapref{modules}.  The files are loaded
with use_module/2 and only the trapped undefined predicate will be imported
to the module where the undefined predicate was called.  Each library
directory must hold a file \file{INDEX.pl} that contains an index to all
library files in the directory.  This file consists of lines of the 
following format:

\begin{code}
index(Name, Arity, Module, File).
\end{code}

The predicate make/0 updates the autoload index. It searches for all
library directories (see library_directory/1 and file_search_path/2)
holding the file \file{MKINDEX.pl} or \file{INDEX.pl}. If the current
user can write or create the file \file{INDEX.pl} and it does not exist
or is older than the directory or one of its files, the index for this
directory is updated. If the file \file{MKINDEX.pl} exists updating is
achieved by loading this file, normally containing a directive calling
make_library_index/2. Otherwise make_library_index/1 is called, creating
an index for all \file{*.pl} files containing a module.

Below is an example creating a completely indexed library directory.

\begin{code}
% mkdir ~/lib/prolog
% cd !$
% pl -g true -t 'make_library_index(.)'
\end{code}

If there are more than one library files containing the desired predicate
the following search schema is followed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If there is a library file that defines the module in which
        the undefined predicate is trapped, this file is used.
  \item Otherwise library files are considered in the order they appear
        in the library_directory/1 predicate and within the directory
        alphabetically.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{make_library_index}{1}{+Directory}
Create an index for this directory.  The index is written to the file
'INDEX.pl' in the specified directory.  Fails with a warning if the
directory does not exist or is write protected.
    
    \predicate{make_library_index}{2}{+Directory, +ListOfPatterns}
Normally used in \file{MKINDEX.pl}, this predicate creates \file{INDEX.pl}
for \arg{Directory}, indexing all files that match one of the file-patterns
in \arg{ListOfPatterns}.

Sometimes library packages consist of one public load file and a number
of files used by this load-file, exporting predicates that should not be
used directly by the end-user. Such a library can be placed in a
sub-directory of the library and the files containing public
functionality can be added to the index of the library.  As an
example we give the XPCE library's \file{MKINDEX.pl}, including the
public functionality of \file{trace/browse.pl} to the autoloadable
predicates for the XPCE package.

\begin{code}
:- make_library_index('.',
		      [ '*.pl',
			'trace/browse.pl'
		      ]).
\end{code}

    \predicate{reload_library_index}{0}{}
Force reloading the index after modifying the set of library directories
by changing the rules for library_directory/1, file_search_path/2,
adding or deleting \file{INDEX.pl} files. This predicate does \emph{not}
update the \file{INDEX.pl} files.  Check make_library_index/[1,2] and
make/0 for updating the index files.

Normally, the index is reloaded automatically if a predicate cannot be
found in the index and the set of library directories has changed. Using
reload_library_index/0 is necessary if directories are removed or the
order of the library directories is changed.
\end{description}


\section{Garbage Collection}			\label{sec:gc}

SWI-Prolog provides garbage-collection, last-call optimization and atom
garbage collection.  These features are controlled using Prolog flags
(see current_prolog_flag/2).


\section{Syntax Notes}				\label{sec:syntax}

SWI-Prolog uses ISO-Prolog standard syntax, which is closely compatible
to Edinburgh Prolog syntax. A description of this syntax can be found in
the Prolog books referenced in the introduction. Below are some
non-standard or non-common constructs that are accepted by SWI-Prolog:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [\exam{/* \ldots /* \ldots */ \ldots */}]
The \exam{/* \ldots */} comment statement can be nested. This is useful
if some code with \exam{/* \ldots */} comment statements in it should be
commented out.
\end{itemlist}

\subsection{ISO Syntax Support}			\label{sec:isosyntax}

SWI-Prolog offers ISO compatible extensions to the Edinburgh syntax.

\subsubsection{Processor Character Set}		\label{sec:processorcharset}

\index{ISO Latin 1}\index{character set}%
The processor character set specifies the class of each character used
for parsing Prolog source text.  Character classification is fixed to
use UCS/Unicode as provided by the C-library \ctype{wchar_t} based
primitives.  See also \secref{widechars}.

\subsubsection{Character Escape Syntax} 	\label{sec:charescapes}

Within quoted atoms (using single quotes: \exam{'<atom>'} special
characters are represented using escape-sequences. An escape sequence is
lead in by the backslash (\chr{\}) character. The list of escape
sequences is compatible with the ISO standard, but contains one
extension and the interpretation of numerically specified characters is
slightly more flexible to improve compatibility.

\begin{description}
    \escapeitem{a}
Alert character.  Normally the ASCII character 7 (beep).
    \escapeitem{b}
Backspace character.
    \escapeitem{c}
No output.  All input characters up to but not including the first
non-layout character are skipped.  This allows for the specification
of pretty-looking long lines.  For compatibility with Quintus Prolog.
Not supported by ISO.  Example:
\begin{code}
format('This is a long line that would look better if it was \c
       split across multiple physical lines in the input')
\end{code}
    \escapeitem{\bnfmeta{{\sc RETURN}}}
No output.  Skips input till the next non-layout character or to the
end of the next line.  Same intention as \fmtseq{\c} but ISO compatible.
    \escapeitem{f}
Form-feed character.
    \escapeitem{n}
Next-line character.
    \escapeitem{r}
Carriage-return only (i.e.\ go back to the start of the line).
    \escapeitem{t}
Horizontal tab-character.
    \escapeitem{v}
Vertical tab-character (ASCII 11).
    \escapeitem{xXX..\}
Hexadecimal specification of a character. The closing \verb$\$ is
obligatory according to the ISO standard, but optional in SWI-Prolog to
enhance compatibility to the older Edinburgh standard. The code
\verb$\xa\3$ emits the character 10 (hexadecimal `a') followed by `3'.
Characters specified this way are interpreted as Unicode characters. See
also \verb$\u$.
    \escapeitem{uXXXX}
Unicode character specification where the character is specified using
\emph{exactly} 4 hexadecimal digits.  This is an extension to the ISO
standard fixing two problems.  First of all, where \verb$\x$ defines
a numeric character code, it doesn't specify the character set in which
the character should be interpreted.  Second, it is not needed to
use the idiosyncratic closing \chr{\} ISO Prolog syntax.
    \escapeitem{UXXXXXXXX}
Same as \verb$\uXXXX$, but using 8 digits to cover the whole Unicode
set.
    \escapeitem{40}
Octal character specification.  The rules and remarks for hexadecimal
specifications apply to octal specifications as well.
    \escapeitem{<character>}
Any character immediately preceded by a \chr{\} and not covered by the
above escape sequences is copied verbatim. Thus, \verb$'\\'$ is an atom
consisting of a single \chr{\} and \verb$'\''$ and \verb$''''$ both
describe the atom with a single~\verb$'$.
\end{description}

Character escaping is only available if the
\exam{current_prolog_flag(character_escapes, true)} is active (default).
See current_prolog_flag/2. Character escapes conflict with writef/2 in
two ways: \verb$\40$ is interpreted as decimal 40 by writef/2, but
character escapes handling by read has already interpreted as 32 (40
octal). Also, \fmtseq{\l} is translated to a single `l'. It is advised
to use the more widely supported format/[2,3] predicate instead. If you
insist upon using writef/2, either switch \prologflag{character_escapes} to
\const{false}, or use double \fmtseq{\\}, as in \verb$writef('\\l')$.

\subsubsection{Syntax for non-decimal numbers}	\label{sec:nondecsyntax}

SWI-Prolog implements both Edinburgh and ISO representations for
non-decimal numbers. According to Edinburgh syntax, such numbers are
written as \exam{<radix>'<number>}, where <radix> is a number between 2
and 36. ISO defines binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers using
\exam{0{\em [bxo]}<number>}. For example: \verb$A is 0b100 \/ 0xf00$ is
a valid expression. Such numbers are always unsigned.


\subsubsection{Unicode Prolog source}		\label{sec:unicodesyntax}

The ISO standard specifies the Prolog syntax in ASCII characters. As
SWI-Prolog supports Unicode in source files we must extend the syntax.
This section describes the implication for the source files, while
writing international source files is described in \secref{intsrcfile}.

The SWI-Prolog Unicode character classification is based on version
4.1.0 of the Unicode standard. Please note that char_type/2 and friends,
intended to be used with all text except Prolog source code is based on
the C-library locale-based classification routines.


\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Quoted atoms and strings]
Any character of any script can be used in quoted atoms and strings. The
escape sequences \verb$\uXXXX$ and \verb$\UXXXXXXXX$ (see
\secref{charescapes}) were introduced to specify Unicode code points in
ASCII files.

    \item [Atoms and Variables]
We handle them in one item as they are closely related.  The Unicode
standard defines a syntax for identifiers in computer languages.%
	\footnote{\url{http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/}}
In this syntax identifiers start with \const{ID_Start} followed by a
sequence of \const{ID_Continue} codes. Such sequences are handled as a
single token in SWI-Prolog. The token is a \emph{variable} iff it starts
with an uppercase character or an underscore (\chr{_}). Otherwise it is
an atom.  Note that many languages do not have the notion of
character-case.  In such languages variables \emph{must} be written as 
\verb$_name$.

    \item [White space]
All characters marked as separators in the Unicode tables are handled
as layout characters.

    \item [Other characters]
The first 128 characters follow the ISO Prolog standard. All other
characters not covered by the rules above are considered `solo'
characters: they form single-character atoms. We would like to have a
more appropriate distinction between what is known to Prolog as `solo'
characters and `symbol' characters.
\end{itemlist}


\subsubsection{Singleton variable checking}	\label{sec:singleton}

\index{singleton,variable}\index{anonymous,variable}%
A \jargon{singleton variable} is a variable that appears only one time
in a clause. It can always be replaced by \verb$_$, the
\jargon{anonymous} variable. In some cases however people prefer to give
the variable a name. As mistyping a variable is a common mistake, Prolog
systems generally give a warning (controlled by style_check/1) if a
variable is used only once. The system can be informed a variable is
known to appear once by \emph{starting} it with an underscore. E.g.\
\verb$_Name$. Please note that any variable, except plain \verb$_$
shares with variables of the same name. The term \verb$t(_X, _X)$ is
equivalent to \verb$t(X, X)$, which is \emph{different} from
\verb$t(_, _)$.

As Unicode requires variables to start with an underscore in many
languages this schema needs to be extended.%
	\footnote{After a proposal by Richard O'Keefe.}
First we define the two classes of named variables.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Named singleton variables]
Named singletons start with a double underscore (\verb$__$) or a single
underscore followed by an uppercase letter.  E.g.\ \verb$__var$ or
\verb$_Var$.

    \item [Normal variables]
All other variables are `normal' variables. Note this makes \verb$_var$
a normal variable.%
	\footnote{Some Prolog dialects write variables this way.}
\end{itemlist}

Any normal variable appearing exactly ones in the clause \emph{and}
any named singleton variables appearing more than once are reported.
Below are some examples with warnings in the right column.  Singleton
messages can be suppressed using the style_check/1 directive.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
test(_). 	& \\
test(_a).	& Singleton variables: [_a] \\
test(A).	& Singleton variables: [A] \\
test(_A).	& \\
test(__a).	& \\
test(_, _).	& \\
test(_a, _a).	& \\
test(__a, __a). & Singleton-marked variables appearing more than once: [__a] \\
test(_A, _A).	& Singleton-marked variables appearing more than once: [_A] \\
test(A, A).	& \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section{Infinite trees (cyclic terms)}		\label{sec:cyclic}

\index{infinite trees}\index{cyclic terms}\index{terms,cyclic}%
SWI-Prolog has limited support for infinite trees, also known as cyclic
terms. Full support requires special code in all built-in predicates that
require recursive exploration of a term. The current version supports
cycles terms in the pure Prolog kernel including the garbage collector
and in the following predicates:
\predref{=..}{2},
\predref{==}{2},
\predref{=@=}{2},
\predref{=}{2},
\predref{@<}{2},
\predref{@=<}{2},
\predref{@>=}{2},
\predref{@>}{2},
\predref{\==}{2},
\predref{\=@=}{2},
\predref{\=}{2},
acyclic_term/1,
bagof/3,
compare/3,
copy_term/2,
cyclic_term/1,
dif/2,
duplicate_term/2,
findall/3,
ground/1,
term_hash/2,
numbervars/[3,4],
recorda/3,
recordz/3,
setof/3,
term_variables/2,
throw/1,
when/2,
write/1 (incomplete)
.


\section{Wide character support}		\label{sec:widechars}

\index{UTF-8}\index{Unicode}\index{UCS}\index{internationalization}%
SWI-Prolog supports \jargon{wide characters}, characters with character
codes above 255 that cannot be represented in a single \jargon{byte}.
\jargon{Universal Character Set} (UCS) is the ISO/IEC 10646 standard
that specifies a unique 31-bits unsigned integer for any character in
any language.  It is a superset of 16-bit Unicode, which in turn is
a superset of ISO 8859-1 (ISO Latin-1), a superset of US-ASCII.  UCS
can handle strings holding characters from multiple languages and
character classification (uppercase, lowercase, digit, etc.) and
operations such as case-conversion are unambiguously defined.

For this reason SWI-Prolog has two representations for atoms and string
objects (see \secref{strings}). If the text fits in ISO Latin-1, it is
represented as an array of 8-bit characters.  Otherwise the text is
represented as an array of 32-bit numbers.  This representational issue
is completely transparent to the Prolog user.  Users of the foreign
language interface as described in \secref{foreign} sometimes need to
be aware of these issues though.

Character coding comes into view when characters of strings need to be
read from or written to file or when they have to be communicated to
other software components using the foreign language interface. In this
section we only deal with I/O through streams, which includes file I/O
as well as I/O through network sockets.


\subsection{Wide character encodings on streams} \label{sec:encoding}

Although characters are uniquely coded using the UCS standard
internally, streams and files are byte (8-bit) oriented and there are a
variety of ways to represent the larger UCS codes in an 8-bit octet
stream. The most popular one, especially in the context of the web, is
UTF-8. Bytes 0~\ldots{}~127 represent simply the corresponding US-ASCII
character, while bytes 128~\ldots{}~255 are used for multi-byte
encoding of characters placed higher in the UCS space. Especially on
MS-Windows the 16-bit Unicode standard, represented by pairs of bytes is
also popular.

Prolog I/O streams have a property called \jargon{encoding} which
specifies the used encoding that influence get_code/2 and put_code/2 as
well as all the other text I/O predicates.

The default encoding for files is derived from the Prolog flag
\prologflag{encoding}, which is initialised from the environment.  If the
environment variable \const{LANG} ends in "UTF-8", this encoding is
assumed. Otherwise the default is \const{text} and the translation
is left to the wide-character functions of the C-library.
	\footnote{The Prolog native UTF-8 mode is considerably faster
		  than the generic mbrtowc() one.}
The encoding can be specified explicitly in load_files/2 for loading
Prolog source with an alternative encoding, open/4 when opening files or
using set_stream/2 on any open stream. For Prolog source files we also
provide the encoding/1 directive that can be used to switch between
encodings that are compatible to US-ASCII (\const{ascii},
\const{iso_latin_1}, \const{utf8} and many locales).  See also
\secref{intsrcfile} for writing Prolog files with non-US-ASCII
characters and \secref{unicodesyntax} for syntax issues. For additional
information and Unicode resources, please visit
\url{http://www.unicode.org/}.

SWI-Prolog currently defines and supports the following encodings:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{octet}{}
Default encoding for \const{binary} streams.  This causes
the stream to be read and written fully untranslated.

    \termitem{ascii}{}
7-bit encoding in 8-bit bytes.  Equivalent to \const{iso_latin_1},
but generates errors and warnings on encountering values above
127.

    \termitem{iso_latin_1}{}
8-bit encoding supporting many western languages.  This causes
the stream to be read and written fully untranslated.

    \termitem{text}{}
C-library default locale encoding for text files.  Files are read and
written using the C-library functions mbrtowc() and wcrtomb().  This
may be the same as one of the other locales, notably it may be the
same as \const{iso_latin_1} for western languages and \const{utf8}
in a UTF-8 context.

    \termitem{utf8}{}
Multi-byte encoding of full UCS, compatible to \const{ascii}.
See above.

    \termitem{unicode_be}{}
Unicode \jargon{Big Endian}.  Reads input in pairs of bytes, most
significant byte first.  Can only represent 16-bit characters.

    \termitem{unicode_le}{}
Unicode \jargon{Little Endian}.  Reads input in pairs of bytes, least
significant byte first.  Can only represent 16-bit characters.
\end{description}

Note that not all encodings can represent all characters. This implies
that writing text to a stream may cause errors because the stream cannot
represent these characters. The behaviour of a stream on these errors
can be controlled using set_stream/2. Initially the terminal stream
write the characters using Prolog escape sequences while other streams
generate an I/O exception.


\subsubsection{BOM: Byte Order Mark}		\label{sec:bom}

\index{BOM}\index{Byte Order Mark}%
From \secref{encoding}, you may have got the impression text-files are
complicated. This section deals with a related topic, making live often
easier for the user, but providing another worry to the programmer.
\textbf{BOM} or \jargon{Byte Order Marker} is a technique for
identifying Unicode text-files as well as the encoding they use. Such
files start with the Unicode character 0xFEFF, a non-breaking,
zero-width space character. This is a pretty unique sequence that is not
likely to be the start of a non-Unicode file and uniquely distinguishes
the various Unicode file formats. As it is a zero-width blank, it even
doesn't produce any output. This solves all problems, or \ldots

Some formats start of as US-ASCII and may contain some encoding mark to
switch to UTF-8, such as the \verb$encoding="UTF-8"$ in an XML header.
Such formats often explicitly forbid the use of a UTF-8 BOM. In
other cases there is additional information telling the encoding making
the use of a BOM redundant or even illegal.

The BOM is handled by SWI-Prolog open/4 predicate. By default,
text-files are probed for the BOM when opened for reading. If a BOM is
found, the encoding is set accordingly and the property \term{bom}{true}
is available through stream_property/2. When opening a file for writing,
writing a BOM can be requested using the option \term{bom}{true} with
open/4.


\section{System limits}				\label{sec:limits}

\subsection{Limits on memory areas}		\label{sec:memlimit}

SWI-Prolog has a number of memory areas which are only enlarged to a
certain limit. The default sizes for these areas should suffice for most
applications, but big applications may require larger ones. They are
modified by command-line options. The table below shows these areas. The
first column gives the option name to modify the size of the area. The
option character is immediately followed by a number and optionally by a
\const{k} or \const{m}. With \const{k} or no unit indicator, the value
is interpreted in Kbytes (1024 bytes), with \const{m}, the value is
interpreted in Mbytes ($1024 \times 1024$ bytes).

The local-, global- and trail-stack are limited to 128 Mbytes on 32 bit
processors, or more generally to $\pow{2}{\mbox{bits-per-long} - 5}$
bytes.

The PrologScript facility described in \secref{plscript} provides a 
mechanism for specifying options with the load-file.  On Windows the
default stack-sizes are controlled using the Windows \idx{registry}
on the key \verb$HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SWI\Prolog$ using the
names \const{localSize}, \const{globalSize} and \const{trailSize}.  The
value is a \const{DWORD} expressing the default stack size in Kbytes.
A GUI for modifying these values is provided using the XPCE package.
To use this, start the XPCE manual tools using manpce/0, after which
you find \textit{Preferences} in the \textit{File} menu.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|p{5cm}|}
\hline
Option & Default & Area name & Description \\
\hline
\cmdlineoption{-L} & 16M & \bf local stack & The local stack is used to store
                       the execution environments of procedure
                       invocations. The space for an environment is
                       reclaimed when it fails, exits without leaving
                       choice points, the alternatives are cut off with
                       the !/0 predicate or no choice points have
                       been created since the invocation and the last
                       subclause is started (last call optimisation). \\
\cmdlineoption{-G} & 32M & \bf global stack & The global stack is used
                       to store terms created during Prolog's
                       execution. Terms on this stack will be reclaimed
                       by backtracking to a point before the term
                       was created or by garbage collection (provided the
                       term is no longer referenced). \\
\cmdlineoption{-T} & 32M & \bf trail stack & The trail stack is used to store
                       assignments during execution.  Entries on this
                       stack remain alive until backtracking before the
                       point of creation or the garbage collector 
                       determines they are nor needed any longer. \\
\cmdlineoption{-A} & 1M & \bf argument stack & The argument stack is used to
                       store one of the intermediate code interpreter's 
                       registers. The amount of space needed on this
                       stack is determined entirely by the depth in
                       which terms are nested in the clauses that
                       constitute the program. Overflow is most likely
                       when using long strings in a clause.

		       In addition, this stack is used by some built-in
		       predicates to handle cyclic terms.  Its default
		       size limit is proportional to the global stack 
		       limit such that it will never overflow. \\

\subsubsection{The heap}			\label{sec:heap}

\index{stack,memory management}%
\index{memory,layout}%
With the heap, we refer to the memory area used by malloc()
and friends. SWI-Prolog uses the area to store atoms, functors,
predicates and their clauses, records and other dynamic data.  As of
SWI-Prolog 2.8.5, no limits are imposed on the addresses returned by
malloc() and friends.

On some machines, the runtime stacks described above are allocated using
`sparse allocation'. Virtual space up to the limit is claimed at startup
and committed and released while the area grows and shrinks.  On Win32
platform this is realised using VirtualAlloc() and friends.
On Unix systems this is realised using mmap().

\subsection{Other Limits}			\label{sec:morelimits}

\begin{description}
    \item[Clauses]
The only limit on clauses is their arity (the number of arguments to
the head), which is limited to 1024.  Raising this limit is easy and
relatively cheap, removing it is harder.

    \item[Atoms and Strings]
SWI-Prolog has no limits on the sizes of atoms and strings.  read/1 and
its derivatives however normally limit the number of newlines in an atom
or string to 5 to improve error detection and recovery.  This can be
switched off with style_check/1.
   
The number of atoms is limited to 16777216 (16M) on 32-bit machines.  On
64-bit machines this is virtually unlimited.  See also \secref{atomgc}.

    \item[Memory areas]
On 32-bit hardware, SWI-Prolog data is packed in a 32-bit word, which
contains both type and value information. The size of the various memory
areas is limited to 128 Mb for each of the areas, except for the program
heap, which is not limited.  On 64-bit hardware there are no meaningful
limits.

    \item[Nesting of terms]
Many build-in predicates process nested terms using recursive C
functions. Too deeply nested terms generally cause a fatal crash. All
these functions avoid recursion on the right-most argument and therefore
terms are not limited on the nesting level of the last argument. This
notably covers long lists. Most functions use a stack for correct
handling of rational trees (cyclic terms). This stack is segmented,
where different segments are allocated using malloc(). Overflow causes a
non-graceful exit.

    \item[Integers]
On most systems SWI-Prolog is compiled with support for unbounded
integers by means of the GNU GMP library. In practice this means that
integers are bound by the global stack size. Too large integers cause a
\except{resource_error}. On systems that lack GMP, integers are 64-bit
on 32 as well as 64-bit machines.

Integers up to the value of the \prologflag{max_tagged_integer} Prolog
flag are represented more efficiently on the stack. For clauses and
records the difference is much smaller.

    \item[Floating point numbers]
Floating point numbers are represented as C-native double precision
floats, 64 bit IEEE on most machines.
\end{description}

\subsection{Reserved Names}			\label{sec:resnames}

The boot compiler (see \cmdlineoption{-b} option) does not support the module
system.  As large parts of the system are written in Prolog itself
we need some way to avoid name clashes with the user's predicates, 
database keys, etc.  Like Edinburgh C-Prolog \cite{CPROLOG:manual} all
predicates, database keys, etc.\ that should be hidden from the user
start with a dollar (\chr{\$}) sign (see style_check/1).
