<h1>The SWI-Prolog MacOSX app</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a> is an open source
implementation of the Prolog programming language. SWI-Prolog targets at
developing real-world applications. To achieve this, in concentrates on
libraries that facilitate interfacing to other software components,
networking and multi-threading. SWI-Prolog can be used from the
<code>Terminal</code> application, as an standard Mac application started from
<code>Finder</code>, under <a
href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/FAQ/GnuEmacs.html">GNU-Emacs</a> or
under the <a href="http://sewiki.iai.uni-bonn.de/research/pdt/">Eclipse
IDE</a>. </p>

<h2>Supported MacOSX versions</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>MacOS &lt 10.6 (older than Snow Leopard)</b>
<dd>This binary does <b>not</b> run on MacOS prior to Snow Leopard.  You
can install SWI-Prolog using <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>
on most versions.
</dd>
<dt><b>MacOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard)</b>
<dd>
The app does <b>not</b> work on MacOS 10.6. The command line executables
(<code>swipl, swipl-ld</code>) do work.  See <a href="#cmdline">below</a>.
Note that upgrading Snow Leopard or later to Maverics is free of charge.
</dd>
<dt><b>MacOS 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 (Lion, Mountain Lion and Maverics)</b>
<dd>
All features work on these versions of MacOS.

<h3>Using the X11 based development tools</h3>

<p>
The SWI-Prolog development tools, such as the source-level debugger, are
based on xpce, SWI-Prolog's native graphics toolkit. This toolkit
<b>requires X11</b>, and in particular <a
href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/">Xquartz</a>, <b>even</b> on Mac OS
X v10.5 to v10.7 where X11 is preinstalled or can be installed as an
option.  SWI-Prolog's XPCE toolkit is linked against the X11 libraries
in <code>/opt/X11</code>, Xquartz version 2.7.5.
</p>

<p>
The SWI-Prolog app can be executed directly from the disk image, can be
installed in <code>/Applications</code> or in any other location, i.e.,
it is <i>relocatable</i>. The app advertises itself to the launcher as
<em>shell</em> for files with extensions <code>.pl</code> and
<code>.prolog</code>
</p>

<h2 name="cmdline">Using the commandline tools</h2>

<p>
The traditional command line tools are included in the app. To access
them from the <code>Terminal</code> application, add the directory
<code>/Applications/SWI-Prolog/Contents/MacOS</code> to
<code>$PATH</code> (replace with the actual location if you installed
the app in a different location).
</p>

<p>
The Qt based console for this app is developed by Carlo Capelli.
