<h1>üçé The SWI-Prolog MacOSX app</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a> is an open source
implementation of the Prolog programming language. SWI-Prolog targets at
developing real-world applications. To achieve this, in concentrates on
libraries that facilitate interfacing to other software components,
networking and multi-threading. SWI-Prolog can be used from
<b>Terminal.app</b> as well as as an standard Mac application started
from <b>Finder</b>. The commandline application can also run under
several development environments such as GNU-Emacs (see <a
href="https://eshelyaron.com/sweep.html"> Sweep</a>), Eclipse, VSCode,
etc. </p>

<h2>Supported MacOSX versions</h2>

The bundle contains <em>Universal</em> binaries for <code>arm64</code>
(Apple Silicon, M*) and <code>x86_64</code> (Intel).

Starting with SWI-Prolog 9.3.26, the SWI-Prolog app uses native MacOS
Quartz graphics and no longer requires the XQuartz X11 application. We
attempt to support all supported MacOS version. All code is compiled
using 10.15 as <em>Deployment target</em>. While the commandline
<code>swipl</code> executable is reported to run under 10.14, the
GUI is reported <b>not to run</b> under 10.15 while it is reported to
run on MacOS 14.  Please report the status for intermediate versions.


<h3>Using the GUI development tools</h3>

<p>
The SWI-Prolog development tools, such as the source-level debugger, are
based on xpce, SWI-Prolog's native graphics toolkit.  Some of the tools
can be started from the <b>SWI-Prolog.app</b> menus.  Others are started
from the Prolog commandline.   Notably, to use the source level debugger,
use <code>gtrace/0</code> instead of the traditional <code>trace/0</code>
as below.
</p>
<pre>
?- gtrace, my_goal(...).
</pre>

<p>
The <b>SWI-Prolog.app</b> can be executed directly from the disk image, can be
installed in <code>/Applications</code> or in any other location, i.e.,
it is <i>relocatable</i>. The app advertises itself to the launcher as
<em>shell</em> for files with extensions <code>.pl</code> and
<code>.prolog</code>
</p>

<h2 name="cmdline">Using the commandline tools</h2>

<p>
The traditional command line tools are included in the app. To access
them from <b>Terminal.app</b>, add the directory
<code>/Applications/SWI-Prolog.app/Contents/MacOS</code> to
<code>$PATH</code> (replace with the actual location if you installed
the app in a different location).  This provides
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>swipl</code> The non-gui commandline version of SWI-Prolog.  This version
can start GUI development tools.  If you do not want that, use the option <code>--nopce</code>
<li><code>swipl-win</code> This is the same as lauching <b>SWI-Prolog.app</b>, but you can start it from <b>Terminal.app</b> and pass it commandline options.
</ul>
