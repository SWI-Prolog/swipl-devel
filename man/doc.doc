\begin{abstract}
SWI-Prolog is a Prolog implementation based on a subset of the WAM
(Warren Abstract Machine). SWI-Prolog was developed as an {\em open}
Prolog environment, providing a powerful and bi-directional interface to
C in an era this was unknown to other Prolog implementations. This
environment is required to deal with XPCE, an object-oriented GUI system
developed at SWI. XPCE is used at SWI for the development of
knowledge-intensive graphical applications.

As SWI-Prolog became more popular, a large user-community provided
requirements that guided its development. Compatibility, portability,
scalability, stability and providing a powerful development environment
have been the most important requirements. Edinburgh, Quintus, SICStus
and the ISO-standard guide the development of the SWI-Prolog primitives.

This document gives an overview of the features, system limits and
built-in predicates.
