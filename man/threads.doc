\chapter{Multi-threaded applications} \label{sec:threads}

SWI-Prolog multithreading is based on standard C-language multithreading
support. It is not like {\em ParLog} or other paralel implementations of
the Prolog language. Prolog threads have their own stacks and only share
the Prolog \emph{heap}: predicates, records, flags and other global
non-backtrackable data.  SWI-Prolog thread support is designed with the
following goals in mind.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item[Multi-threaded server applications]
Todays computing services often focus on (internet) server applications.
Such applications often have need for communication between services
and/or fast non-blocking service to multiple concurrent clients.  The
shared heap provides fast communication and thread creation is
relatively cheap.%
    \footnote{On an dual AMD-Athlon 1600, SWI-Prolog 5.1.0 
	      creates and joins 4,957 threads per second elapsed time.}

    \item[Interactive applications]
Interactive applications often need to perform extensive computation.
If such computations are executed in a new thread, the main thread can
process events and allow the user to cancel the ongoing computation.
User interfaces can also use multiple threads, each thread dealing with
input from a distinct group of windows.  See also \secref{mt-xpce}.

    \item[Natural integration with foreign code]
Each Prolog thread runs in a native thread of the operating system,
automatically making them cooperate with \jargon{MT-safe} foreign-code.
In addition, any foreign thread can create its own Prolog engine for
dealing with calling Prolog from C-code.
\end{itemlist}

SWI-Prolog multi-threading is based on the POSIX thread standard used on
most popular systems except for MS-Windows. On Windows it uses the
\url[pthread-win32]{http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/} emulation
of POSIX threads mixed with the Windows native API for smoother and
faster operation.


\section{Creating and destroying Prolog threads}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{thread_create}{3}{:Goal, -Id, +Options}
Create a new Prolog thread (and underlying C-thread) and start it
by executing \arg{Goal}.  If the thread is created succesfully, the
thread-identifier of the created thread is unified to \arg{Id}.
\arg{Options} is a list of options.  Currently defined options are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{local}{K-Bytes}
Set the limit to which the local stack of this thread may grow.  If
omited, the limit of the calling thread is used.  See also the
\cmdlineoption{-L} commandline option.

    \termitem{global}{K-Bytes}
Set the limit to which the global stack of this thread may grow.  If
omited, the limit of the calling thread is used. See also the
\cmdlineoption{-G} commandline option.

    \termitem{trail}{K-Bytes}
Set the limit to which the trail stack of this thread may grow.  If
omited, the limit of the calling thread is used. See also the
\cmdlineoption{-T} commandline option.

    \termitem{argument}{K-Bytes}
Set the limit to which the argument stack of this thread may grow.  If
omited, the limit of the calling thread is used. See also the
\cmdlineoption{-A} commandline option.

    \termitem{stack}{K-Bytes}
Set the limit to which the system stack of this thread may grow.  The
default, mimimum and maximum values are system-dependant.

    \termitem{alias}{AliasName}
Associate an `alias-name' with the thread.  This named may be used to
refer to the thread and remains valid until the thread is joined
(see thread_join/2).

    \termitem{detached}{Bool}
If \const{false} (default), the thread can be waited for using
thread_join/2. thread_join/2 must be called on this thread to reclaim
the all resources associated to the thread. If \const{true}, the system
will reclaim all associated resources automatically after the thread
finishes. Please note that thread identifiers are freed for reuse after
a detached thread finishes or a normal thread has been joined.
\end{description}

The \arg{Goal} argument is \emph{copied} to the new Prolog engine.
This implies further instantiation of this term in either thread does
not have consequences for the other thread: Prolog threads do not share
data from their stacks.

    \predicate{thread_self}{1}{-Id}
Get the Prolog thread identifier of the running thread.  If the thread
has an alias, the alias-name is returned.

    \predicate{thread_join}{2}{+Id, -Status}
Wait for the termination of thread with given \arg{Id}.  Then unify
the result-status (see thread_exit/1) of the thread with \arg{Status}.
After this call, \arg{Id} becomes invalid and all resources associated
with the thread are reclaimed. See also current_thread/2.

A thread that has been completed without thread_join/2 being called on
it is partly reclaimed: the Prolog stacks are released and the C-thread
is destroyed. A small data-structure representing the exit-status of the
thread is retained until thread_join/2 is called on the thread.

    \predicate{thread_exit}{1}{+Term}
Terminates the thread immediately, leaving \term{exited}{Term} as
result-state.  The Prolog stacks and C-thread are reclaimed.

    \predicate{thread_at_exit}{1}{:Goal}
Run \arg{Goal} after the execution of this thread has terminated. This
is to be compared to at_halt/1, but only for the current thread.  These
hooks are ran regardless of why the execution of the thread has been
completed.  As these hooks are run, the return-code is already available
through current_thread/2 using the result of thread_self/1 as
thread-identifier.
\end{description}


\section{Monitoring threads}		\label{sec:thmonitor}

Normal multi-threaded applications should not need these the predicates
from this section because almost any usage of these predicates is
unsafe. For example checking the existence of a thread before signalling
it is of no use as it may vanish between the two calls. Catching
exceptions using catch/3 is the only safe way to deal with
thread-existence errors.

These predicates are provided for diagnosis and monitoring tasks. See
also \secref{thutil}, describing more high-level primitives.


\begin{description}
    \predicate{current_thread}{2}{?Id, ?Status}
Enumerates identifiers and status of all currently known threads.
Calling current_thread/2 does not influence any thread.  See also
thread_join/2.  For threads that have an alias-name, this name is
returned in \arg{Id} instead of the numerical thread identifier.
\arg{Status} is one of:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{running}{}
The thread is running.  This is the initial status of a thread.  Please
note that threats waiting for something are considered running too.

    \termitem{false}{}
The \arg{Goal} of the thread has been completed and failed.

    \termitem{true}{}
The \arg{Goal} of the thread has been completed and succeeded.

    \termitem{exited}{Term}
The \arg{Goal} of the thread has been terminated using thread_exit/1
with \arg{Term} as argument.  If the underlying native thread has
exited (using pthread_exit()) \arg{Term} is unbound.

    \termitem{exception}{Term}
The \arg{Goal} of the thread has been terminated due to an uncaught
exception (see throw/1 and catch/3).
\end{description}

    \predicate{thread_statistics}{3}{+Id, +Key, -Value}
Obtains statistical information on thread \arg{Id} as statistics/2
does in single-threaded applications.  This call returns all keys
of statistics/2, although only information statistics about the
stacks and CPU time yield different values for each thread.%
	\footnote{Getting the CPU-time of a different thread is
		  not supported on all platforms.  For Microsoft,
		  it does not work in 95/98/ME.  For POSIX systems
		  it requires times() to return values specific for
		  the calling thread.}.
\end{description}


\section{Thread communication}			\label{sec:threadcom}

\subsection{Message queues}			\label{sec:msgqueue}

Prolog threads can exchange data using dynamic predicates, database
records, and other globally shared data. These provide no suitable means
to wait for data or a condition as they can only be checked in an
expensive polling loop. \jargon{Message queues} provide a means for
threads to wait for data or conditions without using the CPU.

Each thread has a message-queue attached to itself that is identified
by the thread. Additional queues are created using
message_queue_create/2.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{thread_send_message}{2}{+QueueOrThreadId, +Term}
Place \arg{Term} in the given queue or default queue of the indicated
thread (which can even be the message queue of itself (see
thread_self/1). Any term can be placed in a message queue, but note that
the term is copied to the receiving thread and variable-bindings are
thus lost. This call returns immediately.

    \predicate{thread_get_message}{1}{?Term}
Examines the thread message-queue and if necessary blocks execution
until a term that unifies to \arg{Term} arrives in the queue.  After
a term from the queue has been unified unified to \arg{Term}, the
term is deleted from the queue and this predicate returns.

Please note that not-unifying messages remain in the queue.  After
the following has been executed, thread 1 has the term \term{b}{gnu}
in its queue and continues execution using \arg{A} is \const{gnat}.

\begin{code}
   <thread 1>
   thread_get_message(a(A)),

   <thread 2>
   thread_send_message(b(gnu)),
   thread_send_message(a(gnat)),
\end{code}

See also thread_peek_message/1.

    \predicate{thread_peek_message}{1}{?Term}
Examines the thread message-queue and compares the queued terms
with \arg{Term} until one unifies or the end of the queue has been
reached.  In the first case the call succeeds (possibly instantiating
\arg{Term}.  If no term from the queue unifies this call fails.

    \predicate{message_queue_create}{1}{?Queue}
If \arg{Queue} is an atom, create a named queue.  To avoid ambiguity
of thread_send_message/2, the name of a queue may not be in use as a
thread-name.  If \arg{Queue} is unbound an anonymous queue is created
and \arg{Queue} is unified to its identifier.

    \predicate{message_queue_destroy}{1}{+Queue}
Destroy a message queue created with message_queue_create/1.  It is
\emph{not} allows to destroy the queue of a thread.

    \predicate{thread_get_message}{2}{+Queue, ?Term}
As thread_get_message/1, operating on a given queue. It is allowed (but
not adviced) to get messages from the queue of other threads.

    \predicate{thread_get_message}{2}{+Queue, ?Term}
As thread_get_message/1, operating on a given queue. It is allowed to
peek into another thread's message queue, an operation that can be used
to check whether a thread has swallowed a message sent to it.
\end{description}


Explicit message queues are designed with the \jargon{worker-pool} model
in mind, where multiple threads wait on a single queue and pick up the
first goal to execute.  Below is a simple implementation where the
workers execute arbitrary Prolog goals.  Note that this example provides
no means to tell when all work is done. This must be realised using
additional synchronisation.

\begin{code}
%	create_workers(+Id, +N)
%	
%	Create a pool with given Id and number of workers.

create_workers(Id, N) :-
	thread_message_queue_create(Id),
	forall(between(1, N, _),
	       thread_create(do_work(Id), _, [])).

do_work(Id) :-
	repeat,
	  thread_get_message(Id, Goal),
	  (   catch(Goal, E, print_message(error, E))
	  ->  true
	  ;   print_message(error, goal_failed(Goal, worker(Id)))
	  ),
	fail.

%	work(+Id, +Goal)
%	
%	Post work to be done by the pool

work(Id, Goal) :-
	thread_send_message(Id, Goal).
\end{code}


\subsection{Signalling threads}

These predicates provide a mechanism to make another thread execute some
goal as an \jargon{interrupt}.  Signalling threads is safe as these
interrupts are only checked at safe points in the virtual machine.
Nevertheless, signalling in multi-threaded environments should be
handled with care as the receiving thread may hold a \jargon{mutex}
(see with_mutex).  Signalling is probably only makes sense to start
debugging threads and to cancel no-longer-needed threads with throw/1,
where the receiving thread should be designed carefully do handle
exceptions at any point.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{thread_signal}{2}{+ThreadId, :Goal}
Make thread \arg{ThreadId} execute \arg{Goal} at the first
opportunity.  In the current implementation, this implies at the first
pass through the \jargon{Call-port}. The predicate thread_signal/2
itself places \arg{Goal} into the signalled-thread's signal queue
and returns immediately.

Signals (interrupts) do not cooperate well with the world of
multi-threading, mainly because the status of mutexes cannot be
guaranteed easily.  At the call-port, the Prolog virtual machine
holds no locks and therefore the asynchronous execution is safe.

\arg{Goal} can be any valid Prolog goal, including throw/1 to make
the receiving thread generate an exception and trace/0 to start
tracing the receiving thread.

In the Windows version, the receiving thread immediately executes
the signal if it reaches a Windows GetMessage() call, which generally
happens of the thread is waiting for (user-)input.
\end{description}


\section{Thread synchronisation}		\label{sec:threadsync}

All internal Prolog operations are thread-safe. This implies two Prolog
threads can operate on the same dynamic predicate without corrupting the
consistency of the predicate. This section deals with user-level
\jargon{mutexes} (called \jargon{monitors} in ADA or
\jargon{critical-sections} by Microsoft).  A mutex is a
{\bf MUT}ual {\bf EX}clusive device, which implies at most one thread
can \jargon{hold} a mutex.

Mutexes are used to realise related updates to the Prolog database.
With `related', we refer to the situation where a `transaction' implies
two or more changes to the Prolog database.  For example, we have a
predicate address/2, representing the address of a person and we want
to change the address by retracting the old and asserting the new
address.  Between these two operations the database is invalid: this
person has either no address or two addresses, depending on the
assert/retract order.

Here is how to realise a correct update:

\begin{code}
:- initialization
	mutex_create(addressbook).

change_address(Id, Address) :-
	mutex_lock(addressbook),
	retractall(address(Id, _)),
	asserta(address(Id, Address)),
	mutex_unlock(addressbook).
\end{code}


\begin{description}
    \predicate{mutex_create}{1}{?MutexId}
Create a mutex.  if \arg{MutexId} is an atom, a \jargon{named} mutex is
created.  If it is a variable, an anonymous mutex reference is returned.
There is no limit to the number of mutexes that can be created.

    \predicate{mutex_destroy}{1}{+MutexId}
Destroy a mutex.  After this call, \arg{MutexId} becomes invalid and
further references yield an \except{existence_error} exception.

    \predicate{mutex_lock}{1}{+MutexId}
Lock the mutex.  Prolog mutexes are \jargon{recursive} mutexes: they
can be locked multiple times by the same thread.  Only after unlocking
it as many times as it is locked, the mutex becomes available for
locking by other threads. If another thread has locked the mutex the
calling thread is suspended until to mutex is unlocked.

If \arg{MutexId} is an atom, and there is no current mutex with that
name, the mutex is created automatically using mutex_create/1.  This
implies named mutexes need not be declared explicitly.

Please note that locking and unlocking mutexes should be paired
carefully. Especially make sure to unlock mutexes even if the protected
code fails or raises an exception. For most common cases use
with_mutex/2, wich provides a safer way for handling prolog-level
mutexes.  The predicate call_cleanup/[2-3] is another way to guarantee
that the mutex is unlocked while retaining non-determinism.

    \predicate{mutex_trylock}{1}{+MutexId}
As mutex_lock/1, but if the mutex is held by another thread, this
predicates fails immediately.

    \predicate{mutex_unlock}{1}{+MutexId}
Unlock the mutex. This can only be called if the mutex is held by the
calling thread. If this is not the case, a \except{permission_error}
exception is raised.

    \predicate{mutex_unlock_all}{0}{}
Unlock all mutexes held by the current thread.  This call is especially
useful to handle thread-termination using abort/0 or exceptions.  See
also thread_signal/2.

    \predicate{current_mutex}{3}{?MutexId, ?ThreadId, ?Count}
Enumerates all existing mutexes.  If the mutex is held by some thread,
\arg{ThreadId} is unified with the identifier of te holding thread and
\arg{Count} with the recursive count of the mutex. Otherwise,
\arg{ThreadId} is \const{[]} and \arg{Count} is 0.

    \predicate{with_mutex}{2}{+MutexId, :Goal}
Execute \arg{Goal} while holding \arg{MutexId}.  If \arg{Goal} leaves
choicepointes, these are destroyed (as in once/1).  The mutex is unlocked
regardless of whether \arg{Goal} succeeds, fails or raises an exception.
An exception thrown by \arg{Goal} is re-thrown after the mutex has been
successfully unlocked.  See also mutex_create/2 and call_cleanup/3.

Although described in the thread-section, this predicate is also
available in the single-threaded version, where it behaves simply as
once/1.
\end{description}


\section{Thread-support library(threadutil)}	\label{sec:thutil}

This library defines a couple of useful predicates for demonstrating and
debugging multi-threaded applications. This library is certainly not
complete.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{threads}{0}{}
Lists all current threads and their status.  In addition, all `zombie'
threads (finished threads that are not detached, nor waited for) are
joined to reclaim their resources.

    \predicate{interactor}{0}{}
Create a new console and run the Prolog toplevel in this new console.
See also attach_console/0.  In the Windows version a new interactor
can also be created from the {\sf Run/New thread} menu.

    \predicate{attach_console}{0}{}
If the current thread has no console attached yet, attach one and
redirect the user streams (input, output, and error) to the new console
window. On Unix systens the console is an \program{xterm} application.
For this to work, you should be running X-windows and your xterm should
know the \cmdlineoption{-Sccn}.  On Windows systems this requires the
GUI version \program{plwin.exe} rather than the console based
\program{plconm.exe}.

This predicate has a couple of useful applications.  One is to separate
(debugging) I/O of different threads.  Another is to start debugging a
thread that is running in the background.  If thread 10 is running, the
following sequence starts the tracer on this thread:

\begin{code}
?- thread_signal(10, (attach_console, trace)).
\end{code}
\end{description}


\section{Multi-threaded mixed C and Prolog applications}

All foreign-code linked to the multi-threading version of SWI-Prolog
should be thread-safe (\jargon{reentrant}) or guarded in Prolog using
with_mutex/2 from simultaneous access from multiple Prolog threads.
If you want to write mixed multi-threaded C and Prolog application
you should first familarise yourself with writing multi-threaded
applications in C (C++).

If you are using SWI-Prolog as an embedded engine in a multi-threaded
application you can access the Prolog engine from multiple threads by
creating an \jargon{engine} in each thread from which you call Prolog.
Without creating an engine, a thread can only use functions that do
not use the \type{term_t} type (for example PL_new_atom()).

{\bf Please note that the interface below will only work if threading
in your application is based on the same thread-library as used to
compile SWI-Prolog.}


\begin{description}
    \cfunction{int}{PL_thread_self}{}
Returns the integer Prolog identifier of the engine or -1 if the calling
thread has no Prolog engine.  This function is also provided in the
single-threaded version of SWI-Prolog, where it returns -2.

    \cfunction{int}{PL_thread_attach_engine}{PL_thread_attr_t *attr}
Creates a new Prolog engine in the calling thread. If the calling thread
already has an engine the reference count of the engine is incremented.
The \arg{attr} argument can be \const{NULL} to create a thread with
default attributes.  Otherwise it is a pointer to a structure with
the definition below.  For any field with value `0', the default is
used.  The \const{cancel} field may be filled with a pointer to a
function that is called when PL_cleanup() terminates the running
Prolog engines. If this function is not present or returns \const{FALSE}
pthread_cancel() is used.

\begin{code}
typedef struct
{ unsigned long	    local_size;	   /* Stack sizes (K-bytes) */
  unsigned long	    global_size;
  unsigned long	    trail_size;
  unsigned long	    argument_size;
  char *	    alias;	   /* alias name */
  int		   (*cancel)(int thread);
} PL_thread_attr_t;
\end{code}

The structure may be destroyed after PL_thread_attach_engine() has
returned.  On success it returns the Prolog identifier for the thread
(as returned by PL_thread_self()). If an error occurs, -1 is returned.
If this Prolog is not compiled for multi-threading, -2 is returned.

    \cfunction{int}{PL_thread_destroy_engine}{}
Destroy the Prolog engine in the calling thread. Only takes effect if
PL_thread_destroy_engine() is called as many times as
PL_thread_attach_engine() in this thread.  Returns \const{TRUE} on
success and \const{FALSE} if the calling thread has no engine or this
Prolog does not support threads.

Please note that construction and destruction of engines are
relatively expensive operations. Only destroy an engine if performance
is not critical and memory is a critical resource.

    \cfunction{int}{PL_thread_at_exit}{void (*function)(void *),
				       void *closure,
				       int global}
Register a handle to be called as the Prolog engine is detached.  The
handler function is called with one \ctype{void *} argument holding
\arg{closure}. If \arg{global} is \const{TRUE}, the handler is installed
\emph{for all threads}.  Globally installed handlers are executed after
the thread-local handlers.  If the handler is installed local for the
current thread only (\arg{global} == \const{FALSE}) it is stored in
the same queue as used by thread_at_exit/1.
\end{description}


\section{Multithreading and the XPCE graphics system}	\label{sec:mt-xpce}

GUI applications written in XPCE can benefit from the multi-threaded
version of XPCE/SWI-Prolog if they need to do expensive computations
that block to UI in the single-threaded version.

Due to various technical problems on both Windows and Unix/X11 threading
is best exploited by handing long computations to their own thread.

TBD: how should background threads report their results?

The XPCE message passing system is guarded with a single \jargon{mutex},
which synchronises both access from Prolog and activation through the
GUI. In MS-Windows, GUI actions are processed by the thread that created
the window, whereas in Unix/X11 they are processed by the thread that
dispatches messages, which is normally the thread holding the main
console.


\section{Threaded Prolog: Status and plans}

With SWI-Prolog 5.1.0 Prolog threads have become portable and the
performance gap between the single and multi-threaded version has
become acceptable.%
    \footnote{Dual AMD 1600+ running SuSE Linux 7.3: 18\%,
	      Single P-III 733 running SuSE Linux 8.0: 12\%,
	      Single P-III 450 running NT-4/TSE: 1\%.}
Most of the basic machinery and API have been tested on some large
applications and appear to be stable. Especially as we do not anticipate
problems as long as multi-threading is not used or threads do not
interact much we believe it is time to move towards making the
multi-threaded version the default distribution.
