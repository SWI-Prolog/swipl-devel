\section{SWI-Prolog}

SWI-Prolog has been designed and implemented to get a Prolog
implementation which can be used for experiments with logic programming
and the relation to other programming paradigms. The intention was to
build a Prolog environment which offers enough power and flexibility to
write substantial applications, but is straightforward enough to be
modified for experiments with debugging, optimisation or the
introduction of non-standard data types. Performance optimisation is
limited due to the main objectives:  portability (SWI-Prolog is
entirely written in C and Prolog) and modifiability.

SWI-Prolog is based on a very restricted form of the WAM (Warren
Abstract Machine) described in \cite{Bowen:83} which defines only 7
instructions. Prolog can easily be compiled into this language and the
abstract machine code is easily decompiled back into Prolog.  As it is
also possible to wire a standard 4-port debugger in the WAM
interpreter there is no need for a distinction between compiled and
interpreted code.  Besides simplifying the design of the Prolog system
itself this approach has advantages for program development: the
compiler is simple and fast, the user does not have to decide in
advance whether debugging is required and the system only runs slightly
slower when in debug mode.  The price we have to pay is some
performance degradation (taking out the debugger from the WAM
interpreter improves performance by about 20\%) and somewhat
additional memory usage to help the decompiler and debugger.

SWI-Prolog extends the minimal set of instructions described in
\cite{Bowen:83} to improve performance. While extending this set care
has been taken to maintain the advantages of decompilation and tracing
of compiled code. The extensions include specialised instructions for
unification, predicate invocation, some frequently used built-in
predicates, arithmetic, and control (\predref{;}{2}, \predref{|}{2}),
if-then (\predref{->}{2}) and not (\predref{\+}{1}).

This manual does not describe the full syntax and semantics of
SWI-Prolog, nor how one should write a program in Prolog.  These
subjects have been described extensively in the literature.  See
\cite{Bratko:86}, \cite{Sterling:86}, and \cite{Clocksin:87}.  For more
advanced Prolog material see \cite{Keefe:90}. Syntax and standard
operator declarations confirm to the `Edinburgh standard'.  Most built
in predicates are compatible with those described in \cite{Clocksin:87}.
SWI-Prolog also offers a number of primitive predicates compatible with
Quintus Prolog%
    \footnote{Quintus is a trademark of Quintus Computer Systems Inc., USA} 
\cite{QUINTUS:manual} and BIM_Prolog%
    \footnote{BIM is a trademark of BIM sa/nv., Belgium}
\cite{BIMPROLOG:manual}.

ISO compliant predicates are based on ``Prolog: The Standard'',
\cite{Deransart:96}.

\section{Status}

This manual describes version \versionshort\ of SWI-Prolog.  SWI-Prolog has
been used now for several years. The application range includes Prolog course
material, meta-interpreters, simulation of parallel Prolog, learning
systems, natural language processing and two large workbenches for
knowledge engineering. Although we experienced rather obvious and
critical bugs can remain unnoticed for a remarkable long period, we can
assume the basic Prolog system is fairly stable. Bugs can be expected
in infrequently used builtin predicates.

Some bugs are known to the author. They are described as footnotes in
this manual.


\section{Should you be Using SWI-Prolog?}

There are a number of reasons why you better choose a commercial Prolog
system, or another academic product:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [SWI-Prolog is not supported]
Although I usually fix bugs shortly after a bug report arrives, I cannot
promise anything.  Now that the sources are provided, you can always
dig into them yourself.
    \item [Memory requirements and performance are your first concerns]
A number of commercial compilers are more keen on memory and performance
than SWI-Prolog.  I do not wish to sacrifice some of the nice features of
the system, nor its portability to compete on raw performance.
    \item [You need features not offered by SWI-Prolog]
In this case you may wish to give me suggestions for extensions. If
you have great plans, please contact me (you might have to implement
them yourself however).
\end{itemlist}

On the other hand, SWI-Prolog offers some nice facilities:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Nice environment]
This includes `Do What I Mean', automatic completion of atom names,
history mechanism and a tracer that operates on single key-strokes.
Interfaces to standard Unix editors are provided, as well as a facility
to maintain programs (see make/0).
    \item [Very fast compiler]
The compiler handles about 100K bytes per second on a SPARC-II
processor.
    \item [Transparent compiled code]
SWI-Prolog compiled code can be treated just as interpreted code: you
can list it, trace it, assert to or retract from it, etc. This implies
you do not have to decide beforehand whether a module should be loaded
for debugging or not. Also, performance is much better than the
performance of most interpreters.
    \item [Profiling]
SWI-Prolog offers tools for performance analysis, which can be very
useful to optimise programs. Unless you are very familiar with Prolog
and Prolog performance considerations this might be more helpful than a
better compiler without these facilities.
    \item [Flexibility]
SWI-Prolog allows for easy and flexible integration with C, both
Prolog calling C functions as C calling Prolog predicates.  SWI-Prolog
is provided in source form, which implies SWI-Prolog can be linked in
with another package.  Command line options and predicates to obtain
information from the system and feedback into the system are provided.
    \item [Integration with XPCE]
SWI-Prolog offers a tight integration to the Object Oriented Package
for User Interface Development, called XPCE \cite{P1098:C1.6}.
XPCE allows you to implement graphical user interfaces that are
source-code compatible over Unix/X11 and Win32 (Windows 95 and NT).
\end{itemlist}

\section{Version 1.5 Release Notes}

There are not many changes between version 1.4 and 1.5.  The C-sources
have been cleaned and comments have been updated.  The stack memory 
management based on using the MMU has been changed to run on a number
of System-V Unix systems offering shared memory.  Handling dates has
been changed.  All functions handling dates now return a floating
point number, expressing the time in seconds since January 1, 1970.
A predicate convert_time/8 is available to get the year, month, etc.
The predicate time/6 has been deleted.  get_time/1 and convert_time/8
together do the same.

From version 1.5, the system is distributed in source form, rather than
in object form as used with previous releases.  This allows users to port
SWI-Prolog to new machines, extend and improve the system.  If you want
your changes to be incorporated in the next release, please indicate
all changes using a C-preprocessor flag and send complete source files
back to me.  Difference listings are of no use, as I generally won't have
exactly the same version around.


\section{Version 1.6 Release Notes}

Version 1.6 is completely compatible with version 1.5.  Some new features
have been added, the system has been ported to various new platforms and
there is a provisional interface to GNU~Emacs.  This interface will be
improved and documented later.

The WAM virtual-machine interpreter has been modified to use GCC-2's
support for threaded code.

From version 1.6, the sources are now versioned using the CVS version
control system.


\section{Version 1.7 Release Notes}

Version 1.7 integrates the GNU-readline library, offering powerful
history and command-line editing both using Emacs and vi key-bindings.


\section{Version 1.8 Release Notes}

Version 1.8 offers a stack-shifter to provide dynamically expanding
stacks on machines that do not offer operating-system support for
implementing dynamic stacks.


\section{Version 1.9 Release Notes}

Version 1.9 offers better portability including an MS-Windows 3.1
version.  Changes to the Prolog system include:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Redefinition of system predicates]
Redefinition of system predicates was allowed silently in older versions.
Version 1.9 only allows it if the new definition is headed by a
:- redefine_system_predicate/1 directive.
    \item [`Answer' reuse]
The toplevel maintains a table of bindings returned by toplevel goals and
allows for reuse of these bindings by prefixing the variables with the \$
sign.  See \secref{topvars}.
    \item [Better source code administration]
Allows for proper updating of multifile predicates and finding the
sources of individual clauses.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Version 2.0 Release Notes}

\index{Win32s}
Version 2.0 is first of all a freeze of all the features added to the
various 1.9.x releases.  Version 2.0.6 for PC has moved from the WATCOM
C 32-bit windows extender to Windows~NT and runs under Windows 3.1 using
the Win32s NT emulator.

New features offered:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [32-bit Virtual Machine]
Removes various limits and improves performance.
    \item [Inline foreign functions]
`Simple' foreign predicates no longer build a Prolog stack-frame, but
are directly called from the VM.  Notably provides a speedup for the
test predicates such as var/1, etc.
    \item [Various compatibility improvements]
    \item [Stream based I/O library]
All SWI-Prolog's I/O is now handled by the stream-package defined in
the foreign include file \file{SWI-Stream.h}. Physical I/O of
Prolog streams may be redefined through the foreign language interface,
facilitating much simpler integration in window environments.
\end{itemlist}

Version 2.0.6 offers a few incompatibilities:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [retractall/1]
In previous releases, the definition of retractall/1 was:
\begin{code}
retractall(Term) :-
        retract(Term),
        fail.
retractall(_).
\end{code}
As from version 2.0.6, retractall/1 is implemented as a deterministic
foreign predicate compatible with Quintus Prolog.  It behaves as:
\begin{code}
retractall(Head) :-
        retract(Head),
        fail.
retractall(Head) :-
        retract((Head :- _)),
        fail.
retractall(_).
\end{code}
I.e. the definition behaves the same when handling predicates consisting
of facts.  Clauses with a non-true body will be retracted if their head
matches.
    \item [Foreign interface types]
All foreign interface types now have names ending in \ctype{_t} to lessen
the chance for conflicts.  \ctype{term}, \ctype{atomic}, \ctype{functor} and
\ctype{module} have \exam{\#define}'s for backward compatibility.
    \item [PL_register_foreign()]
The attributes is now a bitwise or of the attribute flags rather than
a 0 terminated list.  This has no consequences for predicates that have
no attributes (99\% of them), while predicates with just one attribute
will generate a compiler warning, but work properly otherwise.
Predicates with more than one attributes must be changed.
    \item [\cglobalvar{PL_dispatch_events}]
This pointer is replaced by PL_dispatch_hook(). A function was necessary
for the Win32 \fileext{DLL} interface.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Version 2.1 Release Notes}

In addition to several bug fixes, the 2.1 versions provide some new features:
\begin{itemlist}
    \item [setarg/3]
A new predicate setarg/3 for extra-logical (destructive) assignment to
arguments of terms is provided.
    \item [Modified keysort/2]
keysort/2 is now stable with regard to multiple values on the same key.
Makes this predicate compatible with SICStus and Quintus.
    \item [Modified grammar rule expansion]
DCG translation of free variables now calls phrase/3, which has been changed
slightly to deal with `un-parsing'.  Modification is probably not complete,
but it fixes some problems encountered by Michael B\"ohlen.
    \item [Exception handling]
The top of the runtime stack are automatically dumped on floating point
exceptions.
    \item [Foreign interface]
Added facilities to allow for embedding SWI-Prolog in C applications.
\end{itemlist}

\section{Version 2.5 Release Notes}

Version 2.5 is an intermediate release on the path from 2.1 to 3.0.  All
changes are to the foreign-language interface, both to user- and system
predicates implemented in the C-language.  The aim is twofold.  First of
all to make garbage-collection and stack-expansion (stack-shifts)
possible while foreign code is active without the C-programmer having
to worry about locking and unlocking C-variables pointing to Prolog
terms.  The new approach is closely compatible to the Quintus and
SICStus Prolog foreign interface using the \const{+term} argument
specification (see their respective manuals).  This allows for writing
foreign interfaces that are easily portable over these three Prolog
platforms.

According to the current plan, ISO compliant exception handling and
hooks for source-code debugging will be added before the system will
be called 3.0.

Apart from various bug fixes listed in the Changelog file, these
are the main changes since 2.1.0:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [ISO compatibility]
Many ISO compatibility features have been added: open/4, arithmetic
functions, syntax, etc.
    \item [WIN32]
Many fixes for the Win32 (NT, '95 and win32s) platforms.  Notably
many problems related to pathnames and a problem in the garbage
collector.
    \item [Performance]
Many changes to the clause indexing system: added hash-tables,
lazy computation of the index information, etc.
    \item [Portable saved-states]
The predicate qsave_program/[1,2] allows for the creating of machine
independent saved-states that load very quickly.
\end{itemlist}

\section{Version 2.6 Release Notes}

Version 2.6 provides a stable implementation of the features added in
the 2.5.x releases, but at the same time implements a number of new
features that may have impact on the system stability.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [32-bit integer and double float arithmetic]
The biggest change is the support for full 32-bit signed integers and
raw machine-format double precision floats. The internal data
representation as well as the arithmetic instruction set and interface
to the arithmetic functions has been changed for this.
    \item [Embedding for Win32 applications]
The Win32 version has been reorganised.  The Prolog kernel is now
implemented as Win32 DLL that may be embedded in C-applications.
Two front ends are provided, one for window-based operation and
one to run as a Win32 console application.
    \item [Creating stand-alone executables]
Version 2.6.0 can create stand-alone executables by attaching the
saved-state to the emulator.  See qsave_program/2.
\end{itemlist}

\section{Version 2.7 Release Notes}

Version 2.7 reorganises the entire data-representation of the Prolog data
itself.  The aim is to remove most of the assumption on the machine's
memory layout to improve portability in general and enable embedding on
systems where the memory layout may depend on invocation or on how the
executable is linked.  The latter is notably a problem on the Win32
platforms.  Porting to 64-bit architectures should be feasible now.

Furthermore, 2.7 lifts the limits on arity of predicates and number of
variables in a clause considerably and allow for further expansion at
minimal cost.


\section{Version 2.8 Release Notes}

\index{Alpha, DEC}\index{DEC, Alpha}% With version 2.8, we declare the
data-representation changes of 2.7.x stable. Version 2.8 exploits the
changes of of 2.7 to support 64-bit processors like the DEC Alpha. As of
version 2.8.5, the representation of recorded the terms has changed, and
terms on the heap are now represented in a compiled format. SWI-Prolog
no longer limits the use of \funcref{malloc}{} or uses assumptions on
the addresses returned by this function.

\section{Version 2.9 Release Notes}

Version 2.9 is the next step towards version 3.0, improving ISO
compliance and introducing ISO compliant exception handling. New are
catch/3, throw/1, abolish/1, write_term/[2,3], write_canonical/[1,2] and
the C-functions PL_exception() and PL_throw(). The predicates
display/[1,2] and displayq/[1,2] have been moved to \pllib{backcomp}, so
old code referring to them will autoload them.

The interface to PL_open_query() has changed.  The \arg{debug} argument
is replaced by a bitwise or'ed \arg{flags} argument.  The values
\const{FALSE} and \const{TRUE} have their familiar meaning, making old
code using these constants compatible. Non-zero values other than
\const{TRUE} (1) will be interpreted different.

\section{Acknowledgements}

Some small parts of the Prolog code of SWI-Prolog are modified
versions of the corresponding Edinburgh C-Prolog code: grammar rule
compilation and writef/2.  Also some of the C-code originates from
C-Prolog: finding the path of the currently running executable and the
code underlying absolute_file_name/2.  Ideas on programming style and
techniques originate from C-Prolog and Richard O'Keefe's {\em thief}
editor.  An important source of inspiration are the programming
techniques introduced by Anjo Anjewierden in PCE version~1 and~2.

I also would like to thank those who had the fade of using the early
versions of this system, suggested extensions or reported bugs.  Among
them are Anjo Anjewierden, Huub Knops, Bob Wielinga, Wouter Jansweijer,
Luc Peerdeman, Eric Nombden, Frank van Harmelen, Bert Rengel.

Martin Jansche (\email{jansche@novell1.gs.uni-heidelberg.de}) has been
so kind to reorganise the sources for version 2.1.3 of this manual.

Horst von Brand has been so kind to fix many typos in the 2.7.14 manual.
Thanks!
