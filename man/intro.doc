\chapter{Introduction}			\label{sec:intro}

This document is a \jargon{reference manual}. That means that it
documents the system, but it does not explain the basics of the Prolog
language and it leaves many details of the syntax, semantics and
built-in primitives undefined where SWI-Prolog follows the standards.
This manual is intended for people that are familiar with Prolog. For
those not familiar with Prolog, we recommend to start with a Prolog
textbook such as \cite{Bratko:86}, \cite{Sterling:86} or
\cite{Clocksin:87}. For more advanced Prolog usage we recommend
\cite{Keefe:90}.


\section{Positioning SWI-Prolog}	\label{sec:swiprolog}

Most implementations of the Prolog language are designed to serve a
limited set of use cases. SWI-Prolog is no exception to this rule.
SWI-Prolog positions itself primarily as a Prolog environment for
`programming in the large' and use cases where it plays a central role
in an application, i.e., where it acts as `glue' between components. At
the same time, SWI-Prolog aims at providing a productive rapid
prototyping environment. Its orientation towards programming in the
large is backed up by scalability, compiler speed, program structuring
(modules), support for multithreading to accommodate servers, Unicode
and interfaces to a large number of document formats, protocols and
programming languages. Prototyping is facilitated by good development
tools, both for command line usage as for usage with graphical
development tools. Demand loading of predicates from the library and a
`make' facility avoids the \emph{requirement} for using declarations and
reduces typing.

SWI-Prolog is traditionally strong in education because it is free and
portable, but also because of its compatibility with textbooks and its
easy-to-use environment.

Note that these positions do not imply that the system cannot be used
with other scenarios. SWI-Prolog is used as an embedded language where
it serves as a small rule subsystem in a large application. It is also
used as a deductive database. In some cases this is the right choice
because SWI-Prolog has features that are required in the application,
such as threading or Unicode support. In general though, for example,
GNU-Prolog is more suited for embedding because it is small and can
compile to native code, XSB is better for deductive databases because it
provides advanced resolution techniques (tabling), and ECLiPSe is better
at constraint handling.

The syntax and set of built-in predicates is based on the ISO standard
\cite{stdprolog:98}. Most extensions follow the `Edinburgh tradition'
(DEC10 Prolog and C-Prolog) and Quintus Prolog \cite{QUINTUS:manual}.
The infrastructure for constraint programming is based on hProlog
\cite{Demoen:CW350}. Some libraries are copied from the
YAP\footnote{\url{http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/\~{}vsc/Yap/}} system.
Together with YAP we developed a portability framework (see
\secref{dialect}). This framework has been filled for SICStus Prolog,
YAP, IF/Prolog and Ciao. SWI-Prolog version~7 introduces various
extensions to the Prolog language (see \secref{extensions}). The
\jargon{string} data type and its supporting set of built-in predicates
is compatibility with ECLiPSe.

\section{Status and releases}			\label{sec:status}

This manual describes version \versionshort{} of SWI-Prolog. SWI-Prolog
is widely considered to be a robust and scalable implementation of the
Prolog language. It is widely used in education and research. In
addition, it is in use for $24 \times 7$ mission critical commercial
server processes. The site \url{http://www.swi-prolog.org} is hosted
using the SWI-Prolog HTTP server infrastructure. It receives
approximately 2.3 million hits and serves approximately 300 Gbytes on
manual data and downloads each month.  SWI-Prolog applications range
from student assignments to commercial applications that count more
than one million lines of Prolog code.

SWI-Prolog has two development tracks. \emph{Stable} releases have an
even \emph{minor} version number (e.g., 6.2.1) and are released as a
branch from the development version when the development
version is considered stable and there is sufficient new functionality
to justify a stable release. Stable releases often get a few patch
updates to deal with installation issues or major flaws. A new
\emph{Development} version is typically released every couple of weeks
as a snapshot of the public git repository. `Extra editions' of the
development version may be released after problems that severely hindered the
user in their progress have been fixed.

Known bugs that are not likely to be fixed soon are described as
footnotes in this manual.


\section{Should I be using SWI-Prolog?}		\label{sec:swiorother}

There are a number of reasons why it might be better to choose a
commercial, or another free, Prolog system:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [SWI-Prolog comes with no warranties]
Although the developers or the community often provide a work-around or
a fix for a bug, there is no place you can go to for guaranteed support.
However, the full source archive is available and can be used to compile
and debug SWI-Prolog using free tools on all major platforms.
Users requiring more support should ensure access to knowledgeable developers.

    \item [Performance is your first concern]
Various free and commercial systems have better performance. But,
`standard' Prolog benchmarks disregard many factors that are often
critical to the performance of large applications. SWI-Prolog is not
good at fast calling of simple predicates and if-then-else selection
based on simple built-in tests, but it is fast with dynamic code,
meta-calling and predicates that contain large numbers of clauses. Many
of SWI-Prolog's built-in predicates are written in C and have excellent
performance.

    \item [You need features not offered by SWI-Prolog]
Although SWI-Prolog has many features, it also lacks some important
features.  The most well known is probably \jargon{tabling}
\cite{oai:CiteSeerPSU:36493}.  If you require additional features
and you have resources, be it financial or expertise, please
contact the developers.
\end{itemlist}

On the other hand, SWI-Prolog offers some facilities that are widely
appreciated by users:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Nice environment]
SWI-Prolog provides a good command line environment, including `Do What I
Mean', autocompletion, history and a tracer that operates on single
key strokes.  The system automatically recompiles modified parts of the
source code using the make/0 command.  The system can be instructed to
open an arbitrary editor on the right file and line based on its source
database. It ships with various graphical tools and can be combined with the
SWI-Prolog editor, PDT (Eclipse plugin for Prolog) or GNU-Emacs.

    \item [Fast compiler]
Even very large applications can be loaded in seconds on most machines.
If this is not enough, there is the Quick Load Format.  See qcompile/1
and qsave_program/2.

    \item [Transparent compiled code]
SWI-Prolog compiled code can be treated just as interpreted code: you
can list it, trace it, etc. This implies you do not have to decide
beforehand whether a module should be loaded for debugging or not, and
the performance of debugged code is close to that of normal operation.

    \item [Source level debugger]
The source level debugger provides a good overview of your current
location in the search tree, variable bindings, your source code and
open choice points. Choice point inspection provides meaningful insight to
both novices and experienced users. Avoiding unintended choice points
often provides a huge increase in performance and a huge saving in
memory usage.

    \item [Profiling]
SWI-Prolog offers an execution profiler with either textual output or
graphical output.  Finding and improving hotspots in a Prolog program
may result in huge speedups.

    \item [Flexibility]
SWI-Prolog can easily be integrated with C, supporting non-determinism
in Prolog calling C as well as C calling Prolog (see \secref{foreign}).
It can also be \jargon{embedded} in external programs (see
\secref{plld}). System predicates can be redefined locally to provide
compatibility with other Prolog systems.

    \item [Threads]
Robust support for multiple threads may improve performance and is a
key enabling factor for deploying Prolog in server applications.

    \item [Interfaces]
SWI-Prolog ships with many extension packages that provide robust
interfaces to processes, encryption, TCP/IP, TIPC, ODBC, SGML/XML/HTML,
RDF, HTTP, graphics and much more.
\end{itemlist}


\section{Support the SWI-Prolog project}	\label{sec:sponsor}

You can support the SWI-Prolog project in several ways. Academics are
invited to cite one of the
publications\footnote{\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/Publications.html}}
on SWI-Prolog. Users can help by identifying and/or fixing problems with
the code or its
documentation.\footnote{\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/howto/SubmitPatch.html}}.
Users can contribute new features or, more lightweight, contribute
packs\footnote{\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list}}. Commercial
users may consider contacting the
developers\footnote{\url{mailto:info@swi-prolog.org}} to sponsor the
development of new features or seek for opportunities to cooperate with
the developers or other commercial users.


\section{Implementation history}		\label{sec:implhistory}


SWI-Prolog started back in 1986 with the requirement for a Prolog that
could handle recursive interaction with the C-language: Prolog calling C
and C calling Prolog recursively. In those days Prolog systems were not
very aware of their environment and we needed such a system to support
interactive applications. Since then, SWI-Prolog's development has been
guided by requests from the user community, especially focussing on (in
arbitrary order) interaction with the environment, scalability, (I/O)
performance, standard compliance, teaching and the program development
environment.

SWI-Prolog is based on a simple Prolog virtual machine called ZIP
\cite{Bowen:83,Neumerkel:93} which defines only 7 instructions. Prolog
can easily be compiled into this language, and the abstract machine code
is easily decompiled back into Prolog. As it is also possible to wire a
standard 4-port debugger in the virtual machine, there is no need for a
distinction between compiled and interpreted code. Besides simplifying
the design of the Prolog system itself, this approach has advantages for
program development: the compiler is simple and fast, the user does not
have to decide in advance whether debugging is required, and the system
only runs slightly slower in debug mode compared to normal execution.
The price we have to pay is some performance degradation (taking out the
debugger from the VM interpreter improves performance by about 20\%) and
somewhat additional memory usage to help the decompiler and debugger.

SWI-Prolog extends the minimal set of instructions described in
\cite{Bowen:83} to improve performance. While extending this set, care
has been taken to maintain the advantages of decompilation and tracing
of compiled code. The extensions include specialised instructions for
unification, predicate invocation, some frequently used built-in
predicates, arithmetic, and control (\predref{;}{2}, \predref{|}{2}),
if-then (\predref{->}{2}) and negation-by-failure (\predref{\+}{1}).


\section{Acknowledgements}	\label{sec:acknowledge}

Some small parts of the Prolog code of SWI-Prolog are modified
versions of the corresponding Edinburgh C-Prolog code: grammar rule
compilation and writef/2.  Also some of the C-code originates from
C-Prolog: finding the path of the currently running executable and
some of the code underlying absolute_file_name/2. Ideas on programming
style and techniques originate from C-Prolog and Richard O'Keefe's {\em
thief} editor. An important source of inspiration are the programming
techniques introduced by Anjo Anjewierden in PCE version~1 and~2.

Our special thanks go to those who had the fate of using the early
versions of this system, suggested extensions or reported bugs. Among
