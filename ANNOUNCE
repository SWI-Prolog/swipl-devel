SWI-Prolog 5.2.7/XPCE 6.2.7 stable release

Status
======
  
  * Stable release integrating shared-database multi-threaded execution.

Brief summary of changes since 5.2.6
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Multi-threading issues: deleting named message queues, avoid deletion
    of message queues with active waiters, abolish of imported predicates.

  * Portability: Cleanup of some Makefile and distribution issues.  Fixed
    alignment problems when compiled with gcc for mk68.  The fix probably
    applies for some other compiler/CPU combinations as well.

Packages
--------

  * XPCE: Various minor improvements.  Added some error checking to improve
    debugging.

  * socket: Complete rewrite of socket handling for Windows, cleaning up the
    design and avoiding a serious bug if sockets were handed to another thread.
    (typically using tcp_accept in one thread and pass the accepted socket to
    a worker-crew for processing).

    Added extensive test-suite (now running without problems for over 50 hours
    on Linux (dual Athlon 1600+) and Windows 2000 advanced server (PIII/733).
