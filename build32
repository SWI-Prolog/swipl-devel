# Build 32-bit SWI-Prolog on 64-bit SuSE Linux.
#
# This is the script we use to build SWI-Prolog and all its packages for
# 32-bit on a 64-bit SuSE Linux  installation.   Edit  to suit the local
# installation requirements and run it. Once correct, upgrading to a new
# release is now limited to getting the new sources and run ./build32.

# Make sure you have the 32-bit   development libraries for all required
# libraries. We found all of them, except for a missing link for libgmp.
# This can be fixed using "cd /usr/lib && ln -s libgmp.so.3 libgmp.so"

# [EDIT] Prefix location of the installation. It is _not_ adviced to use
# a    versioned    prefix.    The    system      will     install    in
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version> and create symlinks from  $PREFIX/bin for the
# main  programs.  Users  can  always  use  older  versions  by  running
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version>/bin/<arch>/pl
