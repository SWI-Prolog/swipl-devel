Installing from source is typically  a  good   idea  on  Linux  and *BSD
systems. On MacOS it is adviced to   use the binary installer or install
from  source  using  Macports  or  Homebrew.   The  Windows  version  is
cross-compiled on a Linux machine  using   MinGW.  We  provide a [Docker
recipe                                                               for
building](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/docker-swipl-build-mingw).
